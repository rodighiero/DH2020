This not only involves the generation of training data, but also the correction of errors by automatic preprocessing. Nowadays there are many methods for automatic text analysis, and just as many tools which encapsulate them for different natural languages as well as for different programming languages. However, there are relatively few annotation tools for correcting annotations or generating training data. The annotation tools mentioned usually only allow a simple annotation of texts as well as a simple visual annotation support. In addition, the use of knowledge databases, such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, Geonames or similar, are rarely usable. Furthermore, the administration of Corpora, the use of different annotation views, the simultaneous and collaborative annotation of the same texts by different users, the user and group-related granting of access permissions to texts, as well as the dynamic determination of Inter-Annotator-Aggreements, are almost non-existent. However, this limited use of annotation tools shows a gap in the large field of digital humanities that can be closed by the so-called TextAnnotator. The TextAnnotator includes a variety of modules for the annotation of texts, which contains the annotation of argumentative, rhetorical, propositional and temporal structures as well as a module for named entity linking and rapid annotation of named entities (Fig. 2). Especially the modules for annotation of temporal, argumentative and propositional structures are currently unique in web-based annotation tools. TextAnnotator, which allows the annotation of texts as a platform, is divided into a front- and a backend component. The backend is a web service based on WebSockets, which integrates the UIMA Database Interface to manage and use texts. UIMA acts as de facto standard for all NLP tasks and almost all preprocessing tools produce a UIMA output. In order to use raw texts and preprocessed texts with TextAnnotator, they first are automatically converted into the UIMA format with the help of the so-called TextImager and preprocessed. In addition, texts are made accessible by using the ResourceManager and the AuthorityManager, based on user and group access permissions (Fig. 1). The use of different components allows the flexible and project-related use of one tool for different purposes. Therefore, texts can be placed in a flexible folder structure and edited by different teams. In addition, different views of a document can be created and used depending on the scenario. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of the use of annotation views (AV). TextAnnotator has access on documents that contain annotation views which are accessible to users. By this assignment TextAnnotator uses the annotations in the individual views for annotation through implemented tools. Figure 2: Extract from an annotation session and the use of KnowledgeBaseLinker. The individual tokens can be linked to knowledge resources or the entries can be modified. In this scenario the texts were already automatically preprocessed by the TextImager and the lower line shows an implicit relation which was interpreted based on the Wikidata entries of the respective assignments to the knowledge database Wikipedia. Through the use of the frontend component, developed in ExtJS, browser-based access to the texts and the available annotation tools is enabled. Once a document has been opened, access is gained to the annotations stored within annotation views in which these are organized. (Fig. 3). Any annotation view can be assigned with access permissions and by default, each user obtains his or her own user view for every annotated document. In addition, with sufficient access permissions, all annotation views can also be used and curated (Fig. 3). This allows the possibility to calculate an Inter-Annotator-Agreement for a document, which shows an agreement between the annotators. Annotators without sufficient rights cannot display this value so that the annotators do not influence each other. This contribution is intended to reflect the current state of development of TextAnnotator, demonstrate the possibilities of an instantaneous Inter-Annotator-Agreement and trigger a discussion about further functions for the community. Figure 3: A open document is shown in TextAnnotator. The annotation views are displayed on the left. User views are named with the names of the users other views are annotation views that can be authorized by the user. The IAA value (right) of the document is visualized based on the selected annotation views (left) and the previously selected annotation classes. The agreement of the annotations can be modified arbitrarily (views, classes) and is calculated directly. At the same time, the agreement is highlighted in different colors.","abrami@em.uni-frankfurt.de, mehler@em.uni-frankfurt.de, s3676959@stud.uni-frankfurt.de",Poster

Modeling data with RDF based OWL ontologies defines a directed graph where nodes are the resources, and the properties the edges. Many digital humanities projects visualize the RDF graphs by flattening them into two dimensions. Although this representation helps researchers with recognizing the direct and indirect connections between the resources, it suffers from loss of information due to the overlap of nodes and edges. One can overcome this problem by visualizing the data as a 3D force graph. An interactive 3D visualization also introduces tangibility to the displayed data so that researchers can rotate the model to study the distribution of the data from every angle. The visualization tool is web-based and connected to a platform that serves the digital editions. This connection enables the users to access the underlying resources by directly clicking on the nodes. Figure 1: 3D force-directed graph of Newton's scientific correspondence. Representation of the data as a 3D force-directed graph is commonly used for scientific data, but it can be easily adapted to the humanities data as well. To illustrate this, we have chosen to visualize the early modern scientific correspondences. Our database consists of the correspondences of natural philosophers such as Leibniz, Newton, Leonhard Euler, and members of the Bernoulli dynasty. There is already a network that connects the digital editions of these correspondences and makes them openly accessible to the public through one platform. This platform is a virtual research environment based on the Knora API, which manages and stores the data as RDF.Users of this platform can access and query the data online using Angular based front-end components of the API, Knora-ui. The 3D visualization tool will be integrated into this user interface and will be openly accessible online. Through Knora, one can derive the graph of the data in the JSON format directly from the triplestore, which is then employed to create a real-time 3D simulation (Figure 1). A configuration step defines graphical features, such as shape, colors, and labels of the nodes and edges (Figure 2). The repulsive forces prescribed on the nodes and edges prevent the overlays of the graph components, and spring-like characteristics of the edges restrain the movement of the nodes. This leads to the formation of clusters of objects that are well connected. Figure 2: Sample 3D visualization of RDF triples. Since time plays a crucial role in the study of the historical facts, an additional dimension has to be introduced into the model to represent the time. In the 3D model, this can be achieved by the dynamic appearance of the nodes relative to the creation date of the letters. All features developed for this tool will be generic and can be used to visualize any RDF based humanities data. We also intend to generate a virtual reality version of the 3D simulations to enhance the interaction of the users with the data.","sepideh.alassi@unibas.ch, lukas.rosenthaler@unibas.ch, robert.iliffe@history.ox.ac.uk",Short Presentation

While information studies offer theoretical foundations and abstract schemes, practice-based resources development such as that described in this paper provides practical outcomes and key solutions. Serpentarium Mundi (www.serpentarium.org) is a specialized digital iconography compendium dedicated to snakes/serpents and their manifold derivatives (e.g. dragons). It catalogues representations of real and imaginary ophiomorphs in the visual arts of Old World civilizations from 3000 BC to 650 AD. The compendium’s compositional framework uses the structural metaphor of traditional (print) media and consists of volumes (e.g. Coins), chapters (e.g. Deities), and articles (e.g. Agathodaemon). A minimalist approach is currently adopted: the compendium articles focus on iconographical (visual) records with the textual component limited to brief descriptions. The advanced version will include three common components: (1) a complete catalogue of the subjects’ iconographic types, consisting of figures supplemented by detailed descriptions and and references; (2) observations on the subject’s reception in antiquity and a survey of related primary sources; and (3) the subject’s interpretation in broader cultural and historical contexts and a survey of the secondary literature. The project website serves as a limited-functionality test prototype of the SOLID (Specialized On-Line Iconography Database) digital framework. The project is a collaborative, multidisciplinary enterprise, enthusiastically sharing the values of the open data movement. It employs expertise in the fields of classics, religious studies, comparative mythology, ethnozoology, art history, and computer science. Serpentarium Mundi draws extensively upon the successes and failures of major online iconography projects, such as Iconclass, Digital LIMC, and The Warburg Institute Iconographic Database. The presentation will inform regarding the current state of the relevant scholarship and will address several project aspects and outcomes: (1) goals established (e.g. becoming the ultimate ophidian iconography resource); (2) challenges encountered (e.g. current lack of institutional support and funding; project curator’s limited technical expertise); (3) lessons learned (e.g. need to anticipate the unforeseen complexities of the evolving image classification taxonomies); and (4) discoveries made (e.g. positive identification of the nebulous iconographic subject). The following technical and organizational features will be discussed: information architecture, functionality, content selection, visual presentation, analytics, and collaboration. The snake/serpent is a ubiquitous and intrinsically polysemantic artistic subject. The notion of “serpent” is the product of the cultural reception of the snake as a peculiar biological species, followed by its creative modification. This transformation is usually accompanied by the complex processes of intra- and inter-cultural interpretation, appropriation, adaptation, preservation, and dissemination. Snakes and serpents play prominent roles in mythology, religion, and art and are important subjects in cultural and cross-cultural (comparative) studies (Mundkur 1983). A substantial body of literature is dedicated to the mythology, symbolism, and iconography of the serpent/dragon in diverse cultural contexts - from the Greco-Roman World and Egypt to India and China, and from the Biblical tradition to early Islam (Charlesworth 2010, Ogden 2013). The theoretical framework of the project is informed by the pertinent discussion on iconography/iconology (Mitchell 1986; van Straten 1994), visual semiotics (Lorenz 2016), metadata (Baca 2016), and knowledge organization (Hjørland 2008). The modified methodological scheme iconography (analytic, proto-iconic stage: pictographic inventorization), iconology (synthetic, proper-iconic stage: descriptive identification), iconosophy (hermeneutic, meta-iconic stage: contextual interpretation) will be introduced (cf. Panofsky 1939). The project is inspired by the pioneering works on the ontology-based iconography conducted at the Warburg Institute (Gartner 2019) and the “Sophia School” (Pavlova-Draganova, Paneva-Marinova, and Pavlov 2011). In this particular context, ontology is understood as a knowledge-organizing process. It provides a conceptual model for describing a system (within a certain domain of discourse) consisting of types of entities, properties, and relations. The primary purpose of ontology is to limit complexity and help to convert data into information and knowledge. The use of ontologies in knowledge-based systems facilitates effective communication between various groups and domains and thus provides the foundation for knowledge dissemination and interdisciplinary collaboration. In this project, classification is the crucial component of the knowledge-organizing process (Szostak 2014). To facilitate the development of classification taxonomies, a novel analytical device, the three-faceted formal semantic indicator (identifier-descriptor-operator) was developed (Figure 1). The device is intended to contribute to future ontology-based iconography research as an instrument facilitating the classification, contextualization, and interpretation of images (Shatford 1986). It could also be potentially incorporated as a functional component into computational procedures involving the machine-readable ontologies (Allemang and Hendler 2011). Figure 1: Formal semantic indicator and relevant ontological/iconographical categories. The experimental application of formal semantic indicators for the classification of numismatic iconographic types will be illustrated on the example of one divine lineage, focusing on three successive generations of principal deities (Figure 2). Figure 2: Depictions of deities interacting with serpents described with the formal semantic indicators. The presentation intends to initiate discussion, solicit feedback, and obtain expert advice from specialists in the fields of database development, cross-domain metadata, semantic web, content/network analysis, data visualization, geographic information systems, and digital museology.",Alexei.Alexeev@uOttawa.ca,Short Presentation

This is particularly the case for serialized fiction: when authors publish a narrative over a series of installments, they open space for a feedback loop with readers. Engaged in an interactive community, invested readers become what Frank Kelleter calls “agents of narrative continuation.” The challenge for contemporary researchers is to reconstruct those communities in the absence of concrete material evidence. Current fan fiction communities can help us make sense of these complex relationships. Given their high publishing volume, as well as the opportunities for commenting, liking and following that the digital platform affords, fan fiction environments, offer unprecedented opportunities to study the relationship between authors and readers in serially published fiction. Fan fiction communities value engagement: texts are often posted by chapter, and commented upon before the text is finished. As such, we can use these archives to explore the author/reader relationship. Our project asks two questions. First, what aspects of reader engagement can predict success for a text? And, in the context of specific stories, how are authors influenced by reader suggestions for content inclusion? For our corpus, we focus on the Harry Potter fan fiction community on fanfiction.net. By limiting our corpus, we control for different kinds of community-based interactions as well as subject and character. As our project is interested in serial publication of novel-length fiction, we acquired all Harry Potter fan fictions over 60,000 words in length, as well as all comments. Our final corpus consists of 16,454 texts with 1.8 billion words. Each chapter is associated with its full metadata, and with the text of its reviews.The fan fiction metadata offers quantitative measures of success to explore in relation to reader engagement. Readers mark stories as “favorites,” providing positive feedback to authors and other readers. Using favorites as a measure of success, we discover that they are highly correlated to the total length of reviews written about the book (0.695). Furthermore, we divided all of the reviews, by chapter, into quartiles. Surprisingly, the most predictive reviews of future success of the text are long reviews posted in response to chapters in the second quartile of the total text length (figure 1).Figure 1: Regression of mean review length in second quartile on number of favorites. These findings indicate that the second quartile is perhaps the most important for securing reader interest (readers, unsure if the text will be completed, are likely less invested in the first quartile). All of our results indicate a close reciprocal relationship between authors and readers in the fan fiction community. Moreover, by tracking the appearance of names in reviews that predate their appearance in the text, we argue that we have identified a proxy measurement for reader influence. In our full presentation, we not only show our results in far more detail, but we also explore the causal relationships between reader feedback and author response. Fan fiction is deeply invested in characters. A topic model run on the corpus returns a model wherein 78 out of 150 topics are predominately character names. Though fan fiction authors work with a fixed set of canonical characters, they make choices on which of those characters to include. We posit that when a character name appears first in the reviews, before it appears in the text, it may indicate that the author was prompted by the review, rather than the original novels. Restricting our model to character names that appeared more than two chapters later in the text (in order to account for false positives), more than 55% of stories contained at least one instance of a character name appearing first in the reviews, with an average 10-chapter delay between suggestion and uptake. Our data indicates that this is highly correlated with the success of the stories: texts in which the author appears to incorporate at least one character-name suggestion from a review has a higher probability of receiving more favorites (figure 2). Based on these results, the fan fiction community appears to be far more interactive than we had hypothesized: authors reliably achieve more success when overtly including suggestions from readers. Figure 2: Regression of number of character suggestions taken on number of favoritesAll of our results indicate a close reciprocal relationship between authors and readers in the fan fiction community. Moreover, by tracking the appearance of names in reviews that predate their appearance in the text, we argue that we have identified a proxy measurement for reader influence.

Frederic Jameson all but claims to when he describes an “​unexpected​...modification” in a character’s life as something that would “​normally​ generate a properly Utopian narrative”. Critics may reject the idea of any given novel’s typicality, but paradoxically rely on a conception of what the typical novel​ ​does as a heuristic to make aesthetic judgments. We know when our expectations have been undercut, but we focus on what that undercutting does, rather than the origins of the expectation. This project shifts the critical focus from the former to the latter.Where Víktor Shklovsky looks for a type of the novel—finding it in ​Tristram Shandy​, the “most typical novel of world literature”—we seek typicality in the no less exaggerated form of the average. In an essay on Josephine Miles’s early distant reading, Brad Pasanek quotes an objection made by a reviewer to Miles’s results that captures the tension between the critical and the computational senses of typicality: “‘If Quarles is “most typical,” in any way at all, of this set of poets,’ which includes Donne, John Milton, and John Dryden, ‘I am immediately convinced that typicality is not a fruitful thing to investigate’”. We argue that reinvigorating the discourse of typicality through operationalization as Miles did forces a necessary confrontation between its meanings in quantitative and qualitative discourse. We present a series of experimental approaches to the question of literary typicality. What, for instance, is the typical novel about? Using the Gale Corpus of American Fiction, which contains more than 18,000 texts published in the United States between 1774 and 1920, we analyze its 2,000 most frequent nouns as a proxy for the subjects of the novels. We then calculate the variance of each word in both concurrent and transhistorical groups to study how centrally embedded each individual text is within its literary field. We experiment with different measures of similarity—Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, and Kullback-Leibler divergence—to analyze which novels and which portions of novels in an individual author’s corpus are least ​unlike​ the others in the set. This analysis challenges the critical shortcut, widespread at least since Auerbach’s ​Mimesis,​ of identifying a given passage as “typical” of a given author. Finally, we use t-stochastic neighbor embedding to plot the relationships among all of the novels in the corpus, and analyze those at the center of the distribution, focusing on one novel that is more centrally located than any other. The same experiments are repeated using verbs: What does the typical U.S. novel do? Through each of these experiments, we offer provisional operationalizations as provocations to think through the problems posed by literary typicality. If readers bring expectations to novels, those expectations come from a range of cultural forces, most salient of which is the novel itself. Are those expectations justified by the predominant features of other novels? Or, to tweak Shklovsky’s formulation, how typical is the average novel?","malgeehe@stanford.edu, fredner@stanford.edu",Lightning

This archive comprising over 15 million documents dating from the 1370s to 1743 - later dispersed into ten collections - is one of the most extensive and most disrupted archives in Western Europe.MIA allows a community of early-modern scholars to collaborate on research projects related to this archival corpus, and publish discoveries following a peer-review protocol. MIA is IIIF compliant, its backend is coded in JAVA (J2EE) and uses MySQL and MongoDB; its frontend is developed using AngularJS. MIA is open source and its code is available on BitBucket (https://bitbucket.org/map-firenze/mia and https://bitbucket.org/map-firenze/mia-fe). Currently the portal contains more than 500.000 digitized documents (half of which on double folios), more than 25.000 transcriptions, 30.000 biographical entries, and 8.000 geographical and topographical records. Private and Public Research Physical accessibility is one of the main problems of archival research - as the latest Covid-19 pandemic has shown - and digitization offers a straightforward solution. However, conventional approaches to digitization are often laborious and costly. The self-digitization of primary sources presents a practical alternative. As this has become common practice in archives in Italy - especially after the Italian Ministry of Cultural Affairs allowed the use of smartphone photography in state archives - the need for a space in which to store, manage, catalog, and easily retrieve these images has become pressing. In order to respond to the critical need for privacy during research, and the scholars’ concerns over 'stolen publications', MIA’s uploaded material can be set as private or public, according to users' needs. By opting for a community-sourced approach, and through a rigorous structure for data entering, MIA is able to maintain the integrity of the data associated with each document: this is a key advantage over crowd-sourced projects, which require a much greater effort. The beta-version was launched in late 2019: since then, over thirty scholars are using it in the spirit of open collaboration. To ensure greater scientific rigorousness, we are in the process of defining a vetting system to verify images and their metadata at various levels: from uploading images in the correct archival collection, to providing an accurate and standardized transcription, to identifying the people and places contained therein. MIA will be made available for the entire scholarly community in the Summer 2020, and the DH2020 conference will be the first occasion in which we present the entire platform with all its functionalities. Peer-reviewed Publishing A key aspect of MIA is the possibility of publishing important archival discoveries, in the form of Short Notices, directly on the portal - supporting the researcher’s need for visibility and enriching their publication record - in an effort to elevate the publishing process within the humanities at a level of speed and efficiency comparable to that of the natural sciences. Once the user has filled out all the necessary metadata accompanying the image uploaded (date; description; typology; transcription; synopsis; people; places) they can click on the ‘submit’ button, and in a matter of (7-10) days will receive feedback from selected peer reviewers. Each Short Notice will be associated with an identifying number that will be used to cite the document in future scholarship. Collaborative Research on and through MIA MIA has been designed to support and encourage collaborative approaches to research. An extensive UX research task has been fulfilled in order to define the requirements for the development of the collaborative workspace. Moreover, we created a specific section in which the user can collaborate on topical projects with other MIA users: a space where to aggregate multiple documents and link them to other resources - such as PDFs, images, URIs, etc. For example, art historians can gather all the documents related to a specific artist (e.g. letters of commission and presentation, contracts, payment records, inventories) from otherwise separate collections in order to work collectively on them; while paleographers can cluster documents together in order to compare stylistic changes in handwriting or to identify an anonymous hand. The broad chronological, thematic, and typological range of the documents housed in MIA makes it a useful research tool for historians of art, medicine, music, religion, print culture, media, and more. A fruitful result of a collaboration within MIA is the work done by the Irish Research Council EURONEWS project (University College Cork - http://euronewsproject.org), which focuses on analyzing pre modern newsletters in order to map their circulation and diffusion in early modern Europe. For this research project MIA provides a solid data-entry infrastructure, including: the uploading of self-digitized manuscripts; qualification of early modern documentary typologies with the appropriate metadata; additional XML encoding for the document transcription and synopsis fields to provide data interoperability for future integration with semantic models (RDF, Linked Data). This feature will support long-term availability and cultural analytics. In addition to storing and classifying the newsletters, MIA has enabled Euronews Project to experiment with the data collected from all the documents written in the year 1600: this has led to further digital analyses that have brought to light issues and elements - such as unknown connections between specific cities and forgotten events that were the talk of European towns - that would have not been uncovered through a traditional approach or by an individual research project. For those archival collections that have not been included in MIA, there is the possibility to create new branches within the git repository, or source code forks, allowing any library, archive, institute, or university to digitize, store, and share their material. One example is the newly created git branch for the Falconieri project (https://bitbucket.org/map-firenze/mia/branch/Falconieri). This project revolves around the study and the digital edition of a corpus of 430 letters sent to the Roman nobleman Ottavio Falconieri between 1655 and 1675. Thanks to MIA these letters, that have always been in the hands of private owners, will finally be accessible to everyone. Conclusions. MIA successfully solves some of the most complex issues of archival research and traditional academic practices: digitally reconstructing the archive through community-sourced uploads; allowing for annotations, transcriptions, and organization of documents; ensuring the integrity of data; enabling collaborative work and discussion; and publishing archival discoveries in the form of Short Notices following a peer-review protocol. Conceived from the start as a collaborative workspace, MIA supports non-linear research paths, gives space to interdisciplinary approaches, and encourages intersections of different disciplines and research methods. In its first public release, it offers a rigorous and dynamic research environment for traditional historians and digital scholars alike.","lorenzo.allori@gmail.com, carlotta.paltrinieri89@gmail.com",Short Presentation

These studies, along with the OpenGLAM movement, have encouraged cultural heritage organisations to make collections available in machine readable formats and to support computational research with the collections, enabling libraries to cast new light on collections and present them in new ways for digital humanities audiences.However, while there have been a number of recent, essential studies around Collections as Data, as well as research into making collections available openly and the reasoning behind this, there has been little to date from an institutional point of view about what is involved in opening up the collections in this way.How can libraries open up collections to wider audiences? How do we turn collections into data? What challenges does this present, relating to rights, access, and data management? What ethical considerations are needed and how can libraries be transparent about decision-making processes as they generate increasing amounts of data, becoming 'producers' of their own collections? This paper lifts the lid on the process of making data available in a national library context and considers the changes to existing activities, processes and outlook in releasing collections as data.The National Library of Scotland launched the Data Foundry (https://data.nls.uk/) in September 2019. As part of the Library’s Digital Scholarship Service, the Data Foundry provides access to data collections including digitised collections; metadata; map and spatial data; and organisational data; with further collections such as web archive and audiovisual data planned for future release.The Data Foundry is based on three core principles: open, transparent and practical. The platform was designed to be a clear, easy-to-use website, with tiered data downloads; clear rights information; and at-a-glance details contextualising the datasets.Collections on the Data Foundry are published openly, in reusable formats, and the Library does not assert further copyright over the datasets it produces. Furthermore, with transparency a key principle, the Data Foundry provides information about data provenance and the reasons behind why and how certain items have been digitised and ‘turned into’ data above others.Producing the Data Foundry has been a Library-wide effort. Working at the intersection of collections, technology and research, the National Library of Scotland’s Digital Scholarship Service draws upon existing expertise across the Library – including Rights, Developers, Curators, Metadata – as well as working closely with researchers to understand their needs.This paper will highlight the practical side of opening up library collections for digital humanities use, exploring the everyday challenges and obstacles such as rights and technical issues and changes to workflows required to produce collections as data, as well as the broader implications of making collections available at scale for libraries and their users.",sarah.ames@nls.uk,Short Presentation

As the practices and methods for producing, sharing, and contesting knowledge change, the enterprise of the university—its disciplinary scholarship, liberal arts mission, and charge to prepare professionals for the world of work—is being reshaped by algorithmic norms. The rise of computational thinking as a transdisciplinary category holds both promise and peril for the humanities. How can humanists, especially digital humanists, take advantage of the push for computational thinking across the curriculum while avoiding the dangers of appropriation? Alternatively, how can those developing and refining computational methods tap into the critical perspectives of the humanities? This paper discusses how an interdisciplinary group of colleagues is drawing on the theory of human-centered computing to develop environments and curricula for students of the humanities to explore the basics of text mining while also providing them with space to critique and resist the imposition of algorithmic rationality.The CTLI foregrounds a particular image of computational thinking across the curriculum, working to identify, stabilize, and study new forms of human-computer partnership that are responsive to disciplinary ways of knowing. Our aim is to study new ways in which individuals or groups of humans, along with computers or groups of computational entities, can come together productively and critically as collective computational-thinking units and build on complementary strengths to investigate problems while rejecting facile technical solutions. The perspective of human-centered computing, that is, the “design of computing systems with a human focus from beginning to end,”1 functions as an Archimedean point of our collaboration.A trans-institutional group of researchers and scholars have assembled at the CTLI, including faculty from the schools of arts and science, engineering, and education as well as the library and the data sciences institute. Together, we are exploring how human-centered computing collaborations transform epistemologies, practices, and pedagogies across disciplines.Following the programmatic overview that Anderson and Ramey presented at DH2019,2 these collaborators selected textual analysis as one of two focus areas (the other being climate change) for the first year of the initiative. Using NetsBlox,3 a block-based programming environment developed at Vanderbilt University, we constructed components and curricula to teach students in the humanities the fundamentals of computational thinking (variables, looping, functions, recursion, etc.) by manipulating textual corpora rather than matrices of numbers. We wanted this environment to be ""low threshold"" enough for middle and high school students to use it as an entry point to disciplinary inquiry, while having a sufficiently ""high ceiling"" to allow scholars of literature and history to use it meaningfully as well.Given our commitment to discipline-specific visions of computational thinking, our pilot project attempted to understand how the professional vision4 of the humanist might resonate with the technological capacity of new computational tools and methods. We viewed human-computer collaboration as an integration of productively-different ways of interacting with the objects of analysis (e.g., texts). Computers and humans “read” differently, and the trick was to find a way to put these ways-of-reading into conversation. We used design-based research5 to investigate possibilities, supporting and studying scholars' creative efforts to engage with technological tools and achieve what they regarded as progress on humanistic projects. We then developed a learning environment that enabled younger students to take on similar relations to computational tools, but in simpler, playful settings. Working with the same computational approaches at different levels of complexity and sophistication, we aimed to gain new perspectives on their power and limitations. We explored a design space with scholars and students centered on the analysis of style and affect in poetry, iteratively identifying and testing functionality with the ultimate objective of creating activities for both secondary-school and undergraduate courses.In the course of our explorations, we narrowed the team’s focus to three different technologies for textual analysis: (i) fundamental natural language processing concepts such as named entity recognition; (ii) word embeddings, such as Word2Vec;6 and (iii) a “query runner” to TEI-encoded documents in BaseX,7 a native XML database. During our collaboration, the team applied each of these technologies, first playfully, to explore what insights they could yield with familiar and constructed texts; then more deliberately, in settings in which it was likely that the computer’s “readings” might be put in productive conversation with humans’ readings. Finally, the team proposed questions, on the one hand, that revealed new patterns in larger corpora; and activities, on the other, that engaged younger learners in reflecting on style as a feature of writing under the writer’s control.In this paper, we report on this first year’s effort and our progress in building a block-based computing environment and curriculum that supports textual analysis by both high school students and professors of literature. We discuss how these tools and perspectives scaffold activities as diverse as teaching secondary students about the linguistic differences between poetry and prose and detecting stylistic patterns among Victorian writers. We also discuss the limitations of taking a human-centered computing approach when conducting digital humanities research; in particular, we examine the drawbacks of block-based languages for text mining in comparison with tools like Lexos8 and Voyant.9","clifford.anderson@vanderbilt.edu, corey.brady@vanderbilt.edu, brian.broll@vanderbilt.edu, lynn.ramey@Vanderbilt.Edu",Short Presentation

The lack of resources to invest in “remedial” actions pushes DH projects towards outdatedness. Additional funding success delays this process by introducing extra resources but, simultaneously, it fast-forwards obsolescence by advancing the field.Indeed, the impact of a DH project can be considered as the ability to establish as common knowledge what was once innovative and cutting-edge by fulfilling its research questions. In this scenario, managing successful DH projects requires addressing competing issues related to the preservation of their integrity (i.e. consistency of data, questions and vision) and of their role and purpose (i.e. their use in the field).The management of legacy systems has been widely studied from a technical perspective, e.g. cost/value, approach to integration, change of use and archiving. Rather than presenting technical solutions, this contribution focuses on the rationale for defining an approach through human, financial and political perspectives.The issue of legacy is not one of data formats but principally a cultural one that we analyse from two distinct approaches:The “restoration” approach, implementing remedial actions that “update” the project to new contexts to preserve its function and role (e.g. extending its data structure to address new questions)The repurposing approach, implementing actions that rethink the value of the project by finding it new purposes, functions and roles in new contexts (e.g. defining new questions to be addressed with its existing data).At stake in the two approaches are the integrity and identity of the project. A project’s integrity is the logical and historical connection between its origin, output and outcomes. A project’s identity is the meaning or role it has within the community of people involved. In this scenario, we argue that addressing a project’s legacy should take into account:The project’s vision, research questions and target “knowledge gap”; the project creators’ motivations and aims; the funding bodies’ goals and prioritiesThe project’s practices, orchestration of people, organisations and tools, operational limits and constraintsThe project’s knowledge, research data and outputs, correlated research activities, answers produced and outcomes (e.g. new projects, scholarly research, education, impact on the field).The contribution then discusses a real case, the UK Reading Experience Database (RED), as emblematic of the challenges of managing legacy DH projects. RED has had a long history, repeated funding successes and significant visibility in Book History scholarly literature. It was devised by Simon Eliot in 1993, first implemented in 1996, published on the web in 2007 and finally closed to new submissions in 2018. RED’s vision was to advance research in the history of reading by establishing a new methodology based on empirical evidence. RED’s practice established strong synergies between researchers, students and volunteers for the distributed acquisition and curation of evidence of reading. The RED contribution form’s structured approach to knowledge encouraged data inputters to pay close attention to the contexts and agents involved in the reading experience: who was reading, what was read, and when and where the act of reading took place.RED data has been successfully converted from a legacy custom relational database to linked open data. Still, RED is a legacy project because of what its data expresses about reading experiences: a now-outdated vision established more than twenty years ago, which has now become embedded in the DH community through successful activities, follow-on projects, publications, research and training initiatives. RED is both a vast database and the centre a wide network of collaborations; therefore addressing its legacy is not a trivial decision.1. The Repurposing of RED: Repurposing RED’s vision means, for instance, rethinking its role from research infrastructure to an educational resource. Consequently, RED’s practices could be reframed as a playground for DH students, providing an environment for training and annotation evaluation. The knowledge produced and encompassed in RED could document the history of DH methods or become a training set for machine-learning algorithms.2. The Restoration of RED. Restoring RED’s vision means, for instance, incorporating in RED new approaches currently required by funding bodies (e.g. collaboration with data science) and current research priorities within Book History, changed considerably since 1993. Consequently, the study of sources could be combined with machine-learning and natural-language processing tools not included in the original structure of RED. Finally, new research questions such as the effects of reading and the multi-modality of reading on new media could be addressed.With a repurposing approach, the integrity of the dataset could be preserved by relinquishing RED’s role as a research project. With a restoration approach, RED’s role as a research project could be preserved through the entire re-curation of its data, the complete re-development of the tool ecosystem to include automatic steps and the entire reassessment of its value as a research resource in light of current DH and Book History research agendas. Unsurprisingly, to keep a project’s role we must face the cost of adapting to the new context, while to keep its form, we must search for a new purpose.On a more general level, there is a question about how to preserve the “human legacy” of RED, e.g. the network of collaborations, student volunteers and contributors engaged. A DH project is a Cultural Artefact, and therefore its historical context can guide the re-tuning of its role as the context changes or the search for new purposes compatible with the values and vision of the social system of the project.As a final remark, we hope these questions can elicit a broader discussion about new and future DH projects and how we could design for their legacy, e.g. the new Reading Europe Advanced Data Investigation Tool.","alessio.antonini@open.ac.uk, francesca.benatti@open.ac.uk, edmund.king@open.ac.uk",Long Presentation

By illustrating the implications of each of these meanings, we show that all three are intricately linked to each other.

As Canadian literary communities adopted audio recording technologies as part of their cultural practices during the 1960s, bissett developed a unique relationship to the tape recorder. At the time, the RCMP used this technology to listen to queer people’s conversations, including those of bissett, document their activities, and regulate their sexuality in order to ensure the nation’s heterosexual status quo. In the poet’s tape recordings ranging from the 1960s-1980s, we hear bissett read poetry theorizing this queer surveillance, documenting his lived experiences as a gay man, and fighting for sexual liberation. We also hear sonic traces of the location and social dynamics of the recorded event and the technology used to capture this moment. Until recently, when SpokenWeb began digitizing and making them available to the wider public, these recordings were kept in private collections and had limited circulation. Following the recordings’ recent shift towards digital public circulation, this presentation considers how listening to bissett’s queer tape recordings in SpokenWeb’s digital archive amplifies his voice, forges queer ways of listening to literary audio, and fosters new public dialogue about Canada’s gay history.SpokenWeb is a multi-institutional research network that digitizes and connects tape and reel-to-reel recordings through its online repository, while creating an online sound archive open to the general public. Audio objects such as these recordings, Canadian sound studies scholars have argued, are significant literary artifacts for investigating previously overlooked Canadian literary histories (Camlot and Marshall; Fong and Shearer). I suggest that SpokenWeb’s digital archive, featuring gay recordings, functions as a site of queer social resistance. As feminist and queer scholars argue, the archive can be a site for queer ethical interventions, allowing us to better understand the concerns and ways of being of queer people in the past and the present (Cvetkovich; Eichhorn). In developing a feminist close listening practice and applying it to digitized literary audio recordings featuring women within SpokenWeb’s collections, Deanna Fong and Karis Shearer have amplified women’s contributions to Canadian literature and determined how women’s labour has been erased from previous literary histories. Whereas Fong and Shearer’s work focuses on listening for women’s contributions within digitized recordings, this presentation shows how listening queerly to SpokenWeb’s gay recordings activates its queer activist potential.Digital humanities scholars have deployed a variety of digital tools to analyze audio by marginalized communities (e.g., pitch analysis [MacArthur]; sound visualization [Hammond and Dick]). However, critical race and sound studies scholar Nina Sun Eidsheim critiques the use of machine learning for engaging with people of colour’s voices, arguing that doing so reproduces racist assumptions of voice (115-117). Along the same critical line, I contend that the use of conventional digital sound analysis tools to analyze sound in bissett’s recordings would reproduce the essentialist stereotypes about gendered voice akin to those of the RCMP’s “fruit machine.” As an alternative approach, I suggest a qualitative listening methodology in which I listen for queer sonic resonances in bissett’s digitized recordings as well as new digital born oral literary history recordings that I produce with the poet. Here, the term “queer” reflects an identity marker for people who do not identify with heteronormative assumptions of gender and sexuality and the term “sonic” means what is audible to the human ear. Informed by queer oral historian practices (Boyd and Ramírez), listening for queer sonic resonances focuses on how bissett interprets and articulates his life through his poetry, uses queerly-coded language based on the event’s context, builds relationships with audiences through discussions of culture, intimacy, friendship, politics, and sexuality, and creates moments of dissonance through silences. To return to the poet’s subjectivity and let the poet speak in response to the archive, I have also conducted and recorded oral history interviews with bissett in which we discussed the earlier recordings’ personal and historical contexts and imagined how these new oral history recordings could provide new historical information by being placed in SpokenWeb’s digital archive. Thus, my research so far has activated the queer activist potential of SpokenWeb’s archive by imagining these recordings not as data to mine but rather as bodies of evidence of queer lived experiences that resist the heteronormative status quo.Through my presentation’s analysis of the recordings, I suggest that engaging queerly with the digital literary audio archive and producing new queer audio reveals contextual information not available through digital analysis tools. Specifically, I compare different performances of bissett’s poem “th wundrfulness uv th mountees our secret police,” which documents his experience of being surveilled and tape recorded by the RCMP. This comparison shows how bissett accentuated different parts of the poem depending on the event, how audiences responded to his work, and how he engaged with tape-recording technology. I also demonstrate how conducting oral history interviews with bissett over the past two years and engaging with the recordings has enlivened them and provided important contextual information about those historical moments. For instance, in previous oral histories interviews when we discussed recordings of “th wundrfulness uv th mountees our secret police,” bissett spoke about his experience of being ostracized by Vancouver’s conservative publics and the Canadian government.

Pure textual search in these corpora is problematic since optical character recognition (OCR) is infamous for performing poorly on such historical material. We propose a novel text-based method for searching through noisy text.We implemented the proposed method for the Wiener Library, one of the most extensive archives on the Holocaust and Nazi era. Established in 1933, the library's unique collection  includes press cuttings, eyewitness testimonies, photographs, as well as published and unpublished works from that era. It includes approximately 150,000 books, reference works, pamphlets and journals and over one million indexed newspaper clippings, unpublished memoirs, and interviews. These documents have been digitized and made available online. Hence, it's of great importance to have a fast search tool for them.We present an easy-to-implement method that enables scholars and the public to effectively search such large collections of textual material that would otherwise be inaccessible due to the lack of reliable transcriptions. Its advantage is its simplicity, in contrast to existing image-based methods (such as various word-spotting methods [1, 2, 3, 4], which are technically involved and need to be rebuilt/retrained for each script style within a dataset. It is based on existing OCR tools that work well for a variety of typefaces and languages. The ease and low cost of implementation enables anyone to apply it to various datasets without substantial expertise in computer vision.MethodGiven a text query, we would like to find the correct matches among the noisy candidates output by the OCR. Our method consists of (A) preprocessing the images, (B) obtaining noisy candidate words using an OCR engine, (C) encoding the query and candidate words into vectors, (D) learning a common subspace between them, and finally (E) ranking the candidates according to distance from the query.For preprocessing (step A), we remove black borders surrounding documents in the images and adjust contrast using the CLAHE algorithm [5] because many documents have non-uniform lighting.Encouraged by recent improvements in OCR software, we chose the Tesseract engine [6, 7] (B) to obtain candidates. Tesseract is open-source and works well for a variety of typefaces and languages.Next, we encode the candidates and queries in fixed-size vectors (C) using the recent pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC) representation [1]. Words with similar spellings are close together in the PHOC vector space.We then use canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) to learn a common subspace between noisy OCR readings and ground truth (D). This step performs ""soft-correction"" by projecting OCR misreadings closer to their ground truth texts in the learned subspace.Lastly, we find the correct candidates using a nearest-neighbor search (E). The most commonly used distance metric for this is cosine distance. However, nearest-neighbor search is by its very nature asymmetric. This causes faulty matching in high-dimensional spaces [8]. We use the recently proposed cross-domain similarity local scaling (CSLS) [9] to mitigate this issue.Experiments and ResultsWe tested the accuracy and speed of our system in an information-retrieval setting on a subset of the Wiener Library's ""500 Document Collection,"" which makes up the main component of the original materials and comprises over 75,000 images that have been scanned from microfilm and microfiche copies of the originals. We annotated 18 pages, totalling 4284 words. Furthermore, we created 20 random splits, each split containing 9 pages for learning the common subspace using CCA, and 9 pages for testing.We used a set of 96 Latin characters for the PHOC representations, thus resulting in a 1440 size binary vector for each word.Table 1: Search results, with and without PHOC encoding or CCA projection and using different metrics. Last column gives average time on a CPU to search through the labeled test set.Table 2: Statistical significance test results.We tested different versions of our system against edit distance. Table 1 shows the performance in the information-retrieval setting. The results of the paired t-tests can be seen in Table 2. Finally, the last column of Table 1 shows the timing comparisons between the methods. The best version of our system (CCA and CSLS) is 9 times faster than edit distance, and achieves almost the same mean average precision (mAP).The difference in performance between edit distance and our method is statistically insignificant, although edit distance performs slightly better on average. The differences between all other methods are statistically significant. This means that the two additions of (1) learning a common subspace to perform soft correction (step D) and (2) using the CSLS metric (step E) were effective in improving the overall performance of our method.Figure 1: Qualitative search results for the entire dataset. Bounding boxes in pink. Our model works wellwith faded ink and approximate matching.Figure 1 shows qualitative search results through the entire dataset. The system finds very long words (""Nationalsozialistische""), as well as approximate matches to a query that has slightly different readings (""Rossenstrasse"" vs. ""Rossenstraße""). As can be seen, OCR performs well on a variety of fonts.ConclusionWe presented a fast and accurate text-based search that is easy to implement and which requires minimal fine-tuning for any given setting. It appears to provide an excellent balance between speed and accuracy. It might make sense to use edit distance to rerank the top results.We applied the system described here to all German-language documents in the Wiener collection. When embedded---as planned---in the library's search tool, this will provide WWII scholars a valuable tool to search effectively through these important historic documents.State-of-the-art OCR works well out of the box for a variety of different languages and fonts. This is important for our dataset because it includes German, Polish, English, and Hebrew texts. Within each language, there are also a variety of styles that must be dealt with.The method does depend on reasonable, though imperfect, OCR results.We also experimented with word-spotting techniques, which could be combined with OCR when needed. See [10] for another example of leveraging poor OCR for finding related texts.Our method is currently being applied to the other languages and to the much larger Yad Vashem collection.AcknowledgementsWe thank Alexey Pechorin and Zahi Hazan for technical help, Hila Buzaglo, Gila Michlovski, Naama Scheftelowitz, Roni Stauber, and their teams at the university libraries for providing the data and helping evaluate outcomes, and Leo Corry for making this all happen.","tbadamdorj@ualberta.ca, adiel.benshalom@gmail.com, nachumd@tauex.tau.ac.il, liorwolf@gmail.com",Short Presentation

The complexity of audio-visual, time-based images, the theoretical premises of film analysis, as well as the overlaps in terminology across different approaches make comparable, systematic film analyses a challenging task. Nevertheless, the possibilities offered by the semantic web as well as linked and open data could change the way in which scholars analyse audio-visual images and relate their findings with each other. The research project ‘Audio-Visual Rhetorics of Affect’ (https://www.ada.cinepoetics.fu-berlin.de/en/index.html – a collaboration of film studies at Freie Universität Berlin and computational sciences at Hasso Plattner Institute, Potsdam) systematically defined film-analytical concepts and their relationships with each other to make them accessible as a semantic ontology for the structuring of film-analytical data. One of our main goals was to provide an open and expandable ontology for researchers concerned with the detailed analysis of the aesthetics of audio-visual images – not just for the application but also as a structural blueprint for further extensions and alternative modes of description. By means of a) providing an analytical framework for a vast variety of research concerned with moving images (from cinema to TV news and web videos), b) open publication and c) a general openness towards extension and progression, our ontology is designed to serve as an intersection between different academic disciplines and traditions.This paper focuses on one of the fundamentals of our film-analytical work – the AdA filmontology (http://ada.filmontology.org/) – and discusses some of its implications. The methodological challenge to map reconstructions of film-viewing experience (see Müller/Kappelhoff 2018) within a digital framework resulted in turning the focus on three basic affordances: 1) Creating a vocabulary that is both grounded in a methodological film-analytical consensus as broad as possible while being at the same time applicable with regard to our specific theoretical framework on the aesthetic experience of audio-visual movement-images. 2) Setting up a mode of description that is defined, operationalized and condensed to a degree that allows for the joint annotation of audio-visual corpora by different analysts as well as the (semi-)automatic generation and visualisation of annotations. And that is 3) explicit enough in its definitions to allow researchers coming from different theoretical backgrounds to relate their approach critically to the analytical data or to adapt our analytical vocabulary to different theoretical frameworks (e.g. neoformalism, narratology or cognitive film theory) by selecting existing and adding new description levels. While the filmontology is currently used to inform qualitative studies on movement patterns, it was published under CC BY-SA 3.0 so that the ontology itself as well as all annotations can be used also in other contexts such as statistical evaluation or citizen science approaches.In order to make the AdA filmontology usable in film-analytical research, we have participated in developing a video annotation software (https://www.advene.org/) – ADVENE – that enables the authoring and publishing of ontology-based video annotations as Linked Open Data by film scholars without programming skills. As a result, we have developed an environment and a set of tools that on the one hand allow for domain experts to directly participate in the development of a semantic vocabulary through familiar spreadsheet tools, and on the other hand enable the automated generation of a machine-readable OWL (W3C Web Ontology Language) ontology from the provided definitions with the help of converters and mappings [Agt-Rickauer et al. 2018]. These efforts resulted in a systematic vocabulary consisting of more than 400 individual values, assigned to more than 80 annotation types that are organized across 8 general levels of description such as Acoustics, Montage, Image Composition or Camera. For example the level Camera encompasses the types Camera Movement Unit, Camera Movement Type, Camera Movement Speed, Camera Movement Direction, Camera Angle, Camera Angle Canted, Camera Angle Vertical Positioning, Lens, Depth Of Field, Defocus, Recording/Playback Speed (see Figure 01).Figure 01: Visualization of the AdA filmontology in Ontoviz.All values, types, and levels are defined according to the ontology’s data model that enables the different kinds of annotations required for in-depth film analysis, including the contrastive or evolving relation between values. The type Camera Angle for instance is defined as: “Perceived vertical angle of (camera) vision. This annotation type provides a scale for camera angles from extreme high angle to extreme low angle.” This scale includes the defined annotation values (extreme high-angle, high-angle, straight-angle, low-angle, extreme low-angle, neither) as well as a ‘syntax-element’ [TO] allowing for the annotation of an evolving relation (see Figure 02). The definitions of all levels, types and values are published as well at ada.filmontology.org.Figure 02: Lodlive visualization of level-type-value-hierarchy for camera angles.The vocabulary and the definitions are so far bilingual (English and German) with the possibility of adding further languages – thus allowing researchers to interconnect research data across language barriers. In our presentation, we will briefly present a selection of annotation types and values to exemplify the structural and definitional traits of AdA Filmontology that differentiate it from other film-analytical vocabularies, such as Abel Thematic List [Abel 2015] or the Movie Ontology (MO) [Bouza 2010], but also point out similarities to ontologies from other disciplines analyzing time-based media and aesthetic experience (e.g. musicology [Freedman 2019]). Furthermore research projects like Digital Formalism [Heftberger 2018], the Distant Viewing Lab [Arnold/Tilton 2019] as well as the ERC Advanced Grant FilmColors [Flückiger 2017] are important points of reference for our work regarding the computational analysis of audiovisual aesthetics at the intersection of Film Studies and Digital Humanities with a perspective of exploring the possibilities for further interoperability between approaches.The AdA filmontology and exemplary annotation datasets using the systematic vocabulary (from feature films, documentaries, TV news and web videos concerning the global financial crisis after 2007) are published regularly under creative commons license. In addition, different ways of visualizing annotations as a ‘graphical score’ (https://olivieraubert.net/hpi/timeline.html) of audio-visual dynamics (http://ada.filmontology.org/explorer/ ; see Figure 03) and querying these semantically structured annotations (see Figure 04) are developed and published online (https://github.com/ProjectAdA/public) in order to make the results available to and readable for other film scholars as well as researchers from other domains.Fig. 03: Several annotation types of a whole feature film in an adjustable and zoomable ‘graphical score’ generated with Advene.Fig. 04: Querying annotation data in the annotation explorer web application.","Jan.Bakels@fu-berlin.de, thomas.scherer@fu-berlin.de, jasper.stratil@fu-berlin.de, Henning.Agt-Rickauer@hpi.de",Long Presentation

This forum aims to move beyond platitudes and interrogate the value of directories and possible models for sustaining them. For whom are tool directories valuable, and in what context? Tool directories require ongoing attention in order to remain relevant -- and more technically sophisticated directories face infrastructure maintenance costs as long as the directory remains online and functional. Some directories have adopted a crowdsourcing model to address content updates, translation, and other necessary functions once grant funding runs out. As unpaid labor increasingly becomes an area of attention and concern for digital humanities, one is left to ask, how ethical are directories, particularly when this volunteer labor is at particular risk of being lost through fragile infrastructure? At a certain point, time and funding are a zero-sum game: are directories actually worth it?This forum is organized by individuals representing a range of DH directories, spanning from 2002 (Geoffrey Rockwell’s TAPoR) to 2020 (Frank Fischer and Laure Barbot representing the Marketplace developed within the SSHOC project), along with the defunct DiRT (Lisa Spiro and Quinn Dombrowski). We will share in advance a brief white paper with case studies and provocative questions, and elicit discussion via Twitter and a mailing list. For the forum itself, we will briefly introduce the context for the discussion to accommodate participants who have not read the white paper (15 minutes). We will then organize the forum attendees into breakout discussion groups, each focused on 1–2 agreed-upon questions (15 minutes). These breakout discussions will last 30 minutes, and each group will have one participant report back to the larger group, which will lead into a general discussion (20 minutes). We will close the forum with a short synthesis and ask participants to suggest next steps (10 minutes).The forum will help the organizers grapple with the difficult decisions that fall out from the “directory paradox”, where the DH community’s praise of directories is wildly incommensurate with the interest or resources available for sustaining them.

Working with digitised newspapers is no different. Each database contains a theoretically-standardised collection of data, metadata, and images, but the precise nature and nuance of this data is often occluded by the automatic processes that encoded it. Moreover, no true universal standard has been implemented to facilitate cross-database analysis, encouraging digital research to remain within existing institutional or commercial silos. Where common standards have been asserted, such as the minimum standards for Europeana or Chronicling America, they have been standardised at only a very low resolution, with significant variance in the range and interpretation of the metadata within their direct collaborations as well as by independent programmes following their example. These irregularities make the data highly vulnerable to misinterpretation by both end users and also those updating the collections in the future.In order to better explore global exchanges (for example, scissors-and-paste journalism) in the nineteenth-century press, Oceanic Exchanges: Tracing Global Information Networks in Historical Newspaper Repositories, 1840-1914 attempted to integrate and make interoperable the metadata used to store digitised newspapers in a variety of linguistic and institutional contexts. This paper will demonstrate how we excavated institutional decision-making from a variety of sources in order to understand the archaeology of digitised newspaper metadata, its vocabulary and structures, and how they related to the conceptions of the newspaper object by both modern end-users and the original nineteenth-century producers. It will explore how computational thinking and data management processes can be combined with discussions of the historical evolution of the newspaper to restore and integrate a narrative that is generally lost in the creation of digital archives: how the strategies and decision-making processes that shaped the composition and structure of the data have, and will continue to, impact user experience and the conclusions drawn from these materials. The Ontologies work package of Oceanic Exchanges had a simple remit: to catalogue and map the metadata terminology used by newspaper databases to one another and to an internal ontology, to support research into reprinting. Because complete documentation was not available for any of our collections, we retro-engineered the implementation of these vocabularies, beginning with document type definitions (DTDs) and schema specifications, complementing them with internal and public documentation on the cataloguing standards used. Some cases also required us to rely upon grey literature—discussions by users about how to manipulate the data— and direct examination of records. Finally, building upon previous research by team members and new interviews, we were able to develop a longitudinal understanding of how the data has been augmented or repackaged by institutions over the past twenty years. Although most of the databases used variants of the METS/ALTO standard, these were not implemented in a way that would allow for simple equivalencies. The variance in terminology, and in the interpretation of the correct range of inputs for a given field, arose from the use of a hodgepodge of different vocabularies, including variants of Dublin Core, METS/ALTO, MPEG-21, PREMIS, as well as other bespoke or proprietary taxonomies. Overlapping and ambiguous vocabularies were also structured inconsistently, with some combining data at the article, page or issue level and others separating the metadata and content for these elements into multiple files. Our initial attempts to account for both internal structures and field equivalencies across these databases made the level of irregularity strikingly clear. Figure 1: Map of all metadata fields from our samples (each one represented by a different colour), with connecting lines showing the internal hierarchy of each, broken down by metadata of physical object, digital object, metadata pertaining to both, and text data. Unmapped blue boxes represent an overflow of repetitive administrative technical metadata. Moreover, the interpretation and implementation of these fields was inconsistent within collections owing to the turnover of staff during the digitisation process as well as the long history of metadata being drawn from existing library catalogues. Such layering is particularly evident in the metadata associated with Trove, the National Library of Australia’s collections, which includes end-user annotations, categorisations and text corrections—layers which are valuable to humanities researchers but which remain in unintegrated grey literature and derived data for the other collections. The level of publically-available documentation about how to interpret both authorised and user-generated fields varied widely, and interviews and internal documents made it clear that consistent implementation of guidelines was unlikely across time. Working with these collections, therefore, requires a creative and flexible interpretation of these standards and an understanding of the history and character of the specific digital files. After working with such disparate source materials, we concluded that the narrative of creation, archiving and digitisation might be most robustly and sustainably documented through a decentralised and layered medium, namely Linked Open Data. This decision is not without controversy. First, although the scale of periodical material makes it particularly tempting for large-scale analysis, the majority of newspaper metadata is in XML format, which presents specific challenges for semantic data modelling. More philosophically, the possibilities and problematics of the semantic web have been theorised since the term was coined in 2001; in particular, the importance of making and sustaining connections to humanistic forms of knowledge representation has been regularly emphasised. Oldman, Doerr and Gradmann highlight the possibility of linked data combining ""digital infrastructure, computer reasoning, interpretation, and digital collaboration"", but warn of leaving a ""mechanical meaningless shell"" if the endeavour is seen as an end in itself, or as a purely scientific exercise. Indeed, linguistics and literary scholars have raised numerous concerns about tool-driven research questions and banal quantification for computation’s sake. Likewise, Berry and Fagerjord have claimed that linked data involves a fragmentation that ""privileges knowledge divided into non-narrative shards of information"", seemingly putting it in direct opposition to the idea of reclaiming lost narratives of creation and use.This paper will, therefore, explore the implications of competing claims surrounding the value of Linked Open Data within the specific domain of digitised periodicals, particularly when working with enriched metadata and data roundtripping (the process of integrating derived data back into the original collections), and demonstrate how combining institutional histories, interviews, metadata and historical narrative detail in a decentralised and layered structure can restore lost narratives and data provenance in a sustainable way that is intelligible across disciplines and at multiple resolutions–whether focusing on the textual content of the issue, the technical details surrounding digitisation, or the computational representation of the physical layout and materials.","m.h.beals@lboro.ac.uk, e.bell@lboro.ac.uk, j.nyhan@ucl.ac.uk, t.hauswedell@gmail.com",Long Presentation

History, for example, draws upon most other social sciences and humanities for obtaining and analysing source materials in different contexts. The multi-modal nature of these sources, the mixing of methodologies into bespoke, project-specific frameworks and the collaboration of researchers with overlapping but distinct interpretations all require a flexible workspace. Moreover, growing calls for open research methods put pressure on humanities researchers to rethink how they document the provenance of their source materials as well as their interpretations. Individual scholars often develop extensive, single-use taxonomies to categorise, encode and describe their conclusions; stored in a variety of document, spreadsheet and database systems, these are rarely disseminated and remain offline penumbra of the research process. Moreover, the prescriptive nature of out-of-the-box software may constrain the annotation process. Larger collaborations may spend significant time developing extensive coding criteria resulting in over-fitted schema with little reusability or reach despite often herculean efforts of dissemination. Even when reusable, these schemas may require a degree of familiarity with the bespoke systems that makes them inaccessible to those outside the project. In order to overcome these difficulties, we have developed a highly extensible database development interface, Nisaba. Rather than prescribe a new database structure or encoding format, Nisaba was developed in order to accommodate a wide variety of source materials, encoding schema and dissemination formats. To achieve this, Nisaba leverages World Wide Consortium (W3C) standards and Linked Data publishing practices, which encourage the explicit provision and reuse of vocabulary terms. Written in Python 3.6 using TKinter, a cross-platform graphical user interface (Linux, OS, Windows), Nisaba functions as both an input and retrieval mechanism. Users input data including text transcriptions, images and [in the future] audio/visual files and apply user-created controlled-vocabularies, free-text annotations and an extensible selection of metadata. Once inputted, users create a segment (a selection of words, pixels or seconds of audio-visual information) and apply further metadata or annotations, allowing a single item to have multiple overlapping annotations using different schema by different users. In order to facilitate the documentation and exportation of data that is restricted or within copyright, the database encodes these segments by word number (text), or relative position (image), allowing precise locators without necessarily exporting the original materials. All data inputs are time-stamped and attached to individual user records, allowing for multiple researchers to annotate the same segments while maintaining unambiguous lines of provenance and allowing longitudinal use of the databases by multiple projects. Once inputted, the material can be retrieved through a simple browsing mechanism (controlled vocabulary) or by exporting layers of the data to non-proprietary formats, currently JSON or Turtle (RDF), allowing for deeply humanistic forms of knowledge representation in a format suitable for computational analysis. This talk will demonstrate the use of Nisaba for various project types and provide guidance on how to develop an open, highly documented dataset to accompany humanities research.","m.h.beals@lboro.ac.uk, albert.merono@vu.nl",Lightning

Est-ce que les livres papier existeront encore dans quelques années ? Ou sera-t-on passé au tout numérique ? Que peut apporter le support numérique dans le domaine de l’édition universitaire ? Ce sont des questions qui se posent encore avec urgence aujourd’hui, à l’heure où la publication académique a certes fait des progrès en matière de diffusion (plateformes de diffusion, libre accès), mais encore très peu d’avancées sur le plan éditorial. En témoigne par exemple la prédominance du format PDF pour les versions papier, ou encore les limites du format EPUB. Ces deux formats, destinés spécifiquement à une édition numérique homothétique au papier, ne permettent pas à la monographie d’embrasser pleinement les potentialités de l’environnement numérique. Une telle ambition suppose que les acteurs en Sciences humaines (SH) s’emparent de leur propre futur en le construisant.Au carrefour des pratiques de lecture classiques et des nouveaux usages liés au numérique, la collection augmentée des Ateliers de [sens public] (accessible à l’adresse https://ateliers.sens-public.org/) propose une complémentarité entre édition papier et édition numérique. Conçus par des chercheur·e·s en SHS, les ouvrages publiés par les Ateliers se distinguent de la monographie académique traditionnelle en explorant des formes d’écriture alternatives : essai, manifeste, échanges épistolaires, carnet de recherche, etc. L’objectif de la collection est de proposer des modèles d’écriture et de publication favorisant la conversation entre les chercheur·e·s, la réappropriation du savoir et l’éditorialisation des contenus publiés. Un tel modèle suppose la mise au point d’une chaîne éditoriale innovante qui engage une attention différente, disséminée et distribuée, privilégiant l’approfondissement par rebonds.Les deux formes de publication qui fondent la collection (édition papier et édition numérique) présupposent des pratiques différentes de lecture et deux approches différentes à la réception des contenus.Le livre papier – ainsi que le numérique homothétique (EPUB ou PDF) qui reproduit à l’identique le livre papier sur un support numérique – tend à une lecture linéaire. Une thèse peut y être présentée et argumentée de façon complexe. Le lecteur sera capable de suivre de manière linéaire le développement de l’argumentation, de reprendre le cheminement de pensée de l’auteur en se laissant accompagner d’un bout à l’autre du discours. La collection impose ainsi un format assez court (120/200 pages), à savoir la longueur adéquate pour présenter une thèse et la démontrer à l’aide d’une argumentation unique et cohérente. La lecture savante d’un livre papier suppose de passer plusieurs heures pour saisir tout le raisonnement de l’auteur. Le discours doit alors nécessairement être linéaire, amenant le raisonnement à sa fin. On cherche alors à minimiser les écarts par rapport au chemin principal. L’appareil critique, les références, les parenthèses, les exemples, les images, les statistiques, les détails… tous ces éléments participent à altérer la linéarité du discours et de la lecture.L’édition numérique augmentée, en revanche, présuppose une lecture non linéaire, qui procède par approfondissement et par associations. L’expérience de lecture sur un sujet débute avec un premier texte dont on souhaite approfondir un aspect. Ce qui semblait n’être qu’un détail se révèle foisonnant lorsque l’on navigue vers un contenu associé mais localisé ailleurs. Cette navigation génère le parcours emprunté par le lecteur. Ce parcours n’a pas été prévu par un auteur ou un éditeur, et ne pré-existe pas à la navigation. Si l’auteur ou l’éditeur ont suggéré des pistes et ouvert des portes vers d’autres contenus, la navigation est effectivement laissée aux lecteurs, selon leurs envies, leurs besoins ou encore leur créativité, c’est-à-dire leur capacité d’association. En ce sens, il n’est pas exact, comme le voudrait Nicholas Carr, que le numérique détruit notre capacité d’attention. En matière de lecture savante, le support numérique de lecture ne favorise pas le suivi d’un discours long et unitaire, mais promeut une attention différente, disséminée, privilégiant l’approfondissement par rebonds. Une telle lecture suppose des efforts d’association qui relèvent déjà d’une activité herméneutique. En libérant le parcours de lecture, c’est une nouvelle responsabilité d’appropriation et d’interprétation qui est transférée dans les mains du lecteur. De son côté, l’éditeur se voit déléguer une nouvelle fonction éditoriale : celle de concevoir et de mettre en place les conditions de l’appropriation et de l’interprétation.Deux objectifs principaux ont motivé le projet des Ateliers de [sens public] :    Réfléchir aux modèles éditoriaux de l’édition numérique enrichie des monographies pour redéfinir un modèle épistémologique pour la monographie - structuration des contenus, balisage, rapports entre papier et numérique - qui réponde aux défis actuels de l’édition numérique.    Fournir une solution logicielle adéquate et opérationnelle pour pouvoir produire des monographies enrichies.La collection des Ateliers de [sens public] offre les deux possibilités de lecture : une édition papier (avec ses analogues homothétiques numériques : EPUB et PDF) et une édition en ligne augmentée. L’édition en ligne augmentée propose le texte en intégralité et en libre accès, ainsi que toute une série de contenus additionnels qui sont autant de portes à franchir pour le lecteur, que ce soit des approfondissements, des sujets connexes, d’autres formes de contenus, d’autres plateformes, d’autres parcours. Le parcours de lecture, propre à chaque lecteur, n’a pas été spécifiquement prévus par l’auteur ou par l’éditeur du livre. C’est également pour cette raison que l’édition en ligne augmentée est gratuite : elle devient un point d’accès vers un univers connecté externe au livre, qui lui échappe et qui n’a été créé ni par l’auteur, ni par l’éditeur. L’édition numérique facilite par ailleurs la navigation à l’intérieur du livre, en proposant des index et des renvois qui démultiplient encore les parcours de lecture. En plus d’une circulation libre des contenus, les liens vers d’autres contenus mettent en place un cercle vertueux entre le travail de l’auteur et celui d’autres auteurs. Ils matérialisent un réseau de connaissances et un dialogue d’idées, sans pour autant sacrifier le discours linéaire, dont la forme de l’argumentation demeure claire, identifiée et reconnaissable dans le champ scientifique. Ces parcours propre à l’édition numérique augmentée sont complémentaires d’une lecture plus classique se plongeant pleinement dans la thèse de l’auteur et dans son cheminement de pensée, propre à l’édition papier ou à ses doubles numériques homothétiques.","lnbeauchef@gmail.com, antoine.fauchie@umontreal.ca, servanne.monjour@gmail.com, nicolas.sauret@umontreal.ca, marcello.vitali.rosati@umontreal.ca, michaelesinatra@gmail.com",Poster

These digital collections provide insights into contemporaneous reporting on a wide range of events, from disruptive, historical turning points, to the banal, mundane aspects of everyday life. While rich in content, digitised newspapers by themselves often lack the essential metadata researchers need to interrogate these collections rigorously.The British Newspaper Archive, for example, boasts that it contains more than 37 million pages, which, although amounting to a large number of words, constitutes only around 6% of the estimated total of newspaper pages. Establishing how the digital “sample” relates to the total “population” of newspapers has been difficult if not impossible. Similar challenges have been found when working with digital book collections (Francois 2013).In this paper, we demonstrate how contextualizing newspapers from the British Newspaper Archive allows scholars to understand the contours of this corpus and to critically interrogate the digital archive for potential biases. Below, we introduce our sources, then explain how we digitized, encoded and linked them, and conclude with some preliminary results that show what type of research could emanate from this work.The Newspaper Press DirectoriesTo investigate the contours of the Victorian press, we set out to digitize the “Newspaper Press Directory”, a contemporaneous record that catalogued periodicals circulating in Britain. Created by Charles Mitchell in 1846, the Directory was published as an annual guide for advertisers, helping them to find relevant audiences. In 1861, Mitchell’s Directory was recognized by the Post Office as an authoritative list of the London and Provincial newspapers (Brake 2015; Gliserman, 1969).  Figure 1: Example from Mitchell’s Press Directory, 1857Figure 1 shows a description of the “Gloucestershire Chronicle” taken from Mitchell’s 1857 edition. The Directory systematically lists the political leaning, price and day(s) of publication, which allows us to profile newspapers, i.e. locate them geographically as well as socially (i.e. places of circulation and audience). Mitchell's attempted to provide a ""dignified"" account of the press, was not unproblematic. As (O'Malley, 2015) points out: the Directory didn't simply reflect the Victorian press but was also an actor that shaped the newspaper landscape.Nonetheless, the directories provide a useful entry point to organizing the 19th century newspapers. We, therefore, attempted to contextualize the British Newspaper Archive by linking this collection to information derived from the Directory. Initially, we focussed on two counties (Lancashire and Dorset) for six different years (1847, 1857, 1860, 1867, 1877, 1888, 1898 and 1908).We selected these two counties because this research takes place in Living with Machines, a larger project focussed on the lived experience of the industrial revolution. The counties experienced different chronologies with respect to their industrialisation: Dorset remained rural for much of the nineteenth century, while Lancashire industrialised early.Methodologically, the biggest challenge lay in parsing and encoding these documents automatically. Mitchell’s Directory adheres to a rather intricate and shifting typographical layout, with many different fonts and transitions between cursive and bold type. This, unfortunately, significantly deteriorated the OCR quality. To process these documents we trained two different models: a page segmentation model that splits the directory into separate entries (each describing one newspaper) and a “semantic” model that overlays the individual entries with more refined annotations (title, price, political leaning, but also named entities such as Location, Person and Institution). The mock example below shows the input and output of this process.Example Input: [...] Proprietor—Henry Smith, general printer, as'the representative of Trustees. (Advertisement, p. 104.)​ NEAL’S CAMBRIDGE GAZETTE. Monthly,Price U/. IMeiifr&il.—Established March, 1855. Circulates in Cambridge and its district.

Proprietor—<person>Jonathan Neal</person>.​<newspaper-end><district-header>CAH.TEBBI1 BY__________{Kent.)​</district-header>To train the models, we first manually labelled a random sample with a tool called INCEpTION (Klie et al. 2018). Structural parsing is roughly equal to page segmentation, which is reflected in the tag set (Table 1). Words that describe a newspaper (as in Figure 1) are classified as “Newspaper” (with “Start” and “Stop” indicating the boundaries). As the directories are organized geographically (by district), we tagged a new location as “District-Header” and its accompanying text as “District-Description”.Figure 2: Table 1: Results of structural parsingWe applied Conditional Random Fields classifier to segment pages. We vectorized the target and neighbouring words using (among others) the following features: use of punctuation and capitals, part-of-speech, named-entity type, etc. We treated word-window, number of iterations and regularization terms as hyper-parameters which we selected based on a grid search. This resulted in a micro f-score of 0.96, training on a corpus of 40 pages and testing on a set of 10 pages.Figure 3: Table 2: Results semantic parsingThe semantic parser takes a segmented page as input, and establishes the “function” of each word in the document, identifying the recurrent elements of the Directory, such as title, price, and political, to which we added other basic named-entities such as Location, Person and Institution.We followed the procedure developed by (Akbik, Blythe, and Vollgraf 2018) which applies contextual string embeddings to sequence labelling. More concretely, we used pre-trained character level Flair embeddings (both the backward and forward pass trained on a corpus of 1 billion words) to encode the tokens, which are subsequently forwarded to a Bi-LSTM. In total, we annotated 240 entries, which we split into a training (166), development (36) and test set (36).Table 2 lists the f-scores obtained after training for 20 epochs. Currently, the tagger fails to accurately identify Organisation-type entities from the descriptions, but it does a reasonable job on other entities such as Locations and Persons. It accurately detects titles and prices but performs less well on the tokens which signal political leaning (this could be due to the many OCR errors).After training both models we applied them to the digitised Directories. Initially, we focussed only on the section that lists provincial newspapers (given the counties of interest, we excluded London), which resulted in a set of almost 7000 newspaper profiles. Figure 4 shows the number of provincial titles over time.Figure 4: Number of provincial newspaper titles over timePotential Research OutcomesBelow we discuss briefly the types of research questions we can answer by contextualizing the Victorian newspaper data. Firstly, we analysed the extent to which digitized newspapers are representative of the broader landscape with respect to their political composition.Figure 5: Distribution of political leaning in sample and population.Figure 5 directly compares the digital sample to the newspaper population, suggesting that the distribution between them differs substantially. The Liberal press, in particular, is overrepresented compared to Neutral and Conservative newspapers (using the categorization applied by the Directory itself). Moreover, some perspectives are simply excluded, such as Catholic voices.Future research needs to explore the impact of these biases, but preliminary experiments already hint at the possibly distorting effects on potential research outcomes and interpretations.Figure 6: Number of words for articles circulating in DorsetFigure 6 shows the word count for all the newspapers that circulated in Dorset. What this timeline fails to convey, however, is a political transition from Conservative to Liberal--which happens in the background, and only becomes visible after integrating information from the Directory (figure 7).Figure 7: Number of words by political party for articles circulating in DorsetBesides explicating the political dimension, the enriched dataset can provide a more holistic view on the geographic circulation of newspaper data as shown in Figure 8, which compares places of publication with circulation.Figure 8: Number of articles by place of publication (left) and place of circulation (right) We thank the National Library of Scotland for access to their tileserver.

These have become vital resources not only for humanities researchers but also for journalists, politicians, schools, and the general public. However, research conducted by the multinational Oceanic Exchanges: Tracing Global Information Networks in Historical Newspaper Repositories, 1840-1914 project has shown that the collections created by digitisation programmes have not always accurately represented the cultural histories of these publications and their producers, especially the relationships with peoples and institutions in other regions; the very creation of national collections obscures the reality that global news exchanges were central to the nineteenth-century press. The role and repercussions of the individual is equally seen in the digitisation process. On the one hand, individuals from a variety of backgrounds, and with a diverse range of remits, create internal policies and processes that shape how newspapers are stored digitally. One the other, individual end users, with different interests and competencies, must work across diverse collections in order to build as full a picture as possible of global information networks, leading to undocumented irregularities and inconsistencies in their research samples.This poster will explore our efforts to bridge the interoperability gap between those creating the authoritative, standardised metadata for these collections and the end users attempting to create historical and other narratives through the use of these materials. It has two objectives:To clarify the decision-making processes behind the structure and creation of digital archives, specifically selection and metadata;To offer historically informed guidelines and models for archives and end-users, to enhance the quality of engagement and development going forward.Our work aims to enable researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds to break through the barriers between siloed collections as well as provide historically-informed principles for archivists and digitisers to consider when implementing their metadata standards. The poster will present visualisations of existing metadata standards for digitised newspapers mapped to researcher-focused ontologies, based on supplementary information and context (the paratext) and developed by the Oceanic Exchanges project using the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS). It will demonstrate how the structures of digital and physical newspaper archives can be explored and manipulated to better inform humanities research questions using semantic web technologies. These visualisations will link to a further resource developed by the Oceanic Exchanges project: The Atlas of Digitised Newspapers, which provides a comparative history of key digitised newspaper collections, including their selection processes, digital infrastructures (including Xpaths and technical definitions) and licensing requirements. These elements—the ontology visualisations and the Atlas —will provide a thoroughly annotated controlled vocabulary designed to be used across disciplines, inside and outside the academy, and provide the basis for further digital humanities research using digitised historical collections.","e.bell@lboro.ac.uk, m.h.beals@lboro.ac.uk",Poster

A visual representation is more accessible, attractive and it can replace complex cognitive calculations. However, selecting the most efficient visualisation can be challenging, especially when conceiving it as a scholarly resource for the representation of abstract concepts. In our case we would need to:condensate pages and pages of dictionaries and historical grammars;add information to previous models to better convey the multidimensionality of modal semantic shifts;  update the traditional visualisation models incorporating motion, color and user interactivity.The semantic map visualisation method was introduced by Haspelmath (2003)2 to describe and illustrate the multifunctionality patterns of linguistic elements. The semantic map appears as a geometric representation of functions connected together in a semantic space. Semantic maps were employed in various ways, cross-linguistically or on individual languages,3 and synchronically or diachronically.Van der Auwera and Plungian apply this resource to visually represent and predict universal patterns of modalisation.4 They build on the single patterns of modalisation for possibility and necessity of the cross-linguistic study by Bybee et al. (see Fig. 1), complementing them with lexical information from other languages. An overview of the modalisation and grammaticalisation paths is achieved by including pre- and post-modal meanings Fig. 1: “To possibility and beyond” Fig. 2: “Unifying the possibility and necessity paths”: Example of a semantic map representing the shifts of possibility and necessity (van der Auwera and Plungian 1998: 98).Our proposal follows this model but our aim is to produce a digital visualisation with these additional features:Diachrony: Addition of a timeline to visualise when new meanings appear.Synchrony: Visualisation of coexisting meanings based on position and shape.Chronology: Addition of the etymological information available for each marker;6 enrichment of each meaning with its first attestation that is displayed by hovering the mouse over that concept.Polyfunctionality: Working with empirical data does not imply unambiguous findings, therefore our proposal codifies multiple modal values of the same marker.Multilingual versions: A map in the source language together with the English translation is available: users can change the language at will.Legibility: Points 1-5 extend the contents of previous models. To guarantee legibility, certain information is color-coded and other pieces of information will appear by user demand. Colors, for instance, are employed to identify and distinguish pre-, post- and modal meanings. Users can bring out a specific path of modal shift just by clicking on one of the affected senses/steps. A combination of shape and position can render the coexistence of meanings.We are currently working on the development of the semantic modal maps of some Latin modal markers. These maps were drafted based on the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (Thesaurusbüro München Internationale Thesaurus-Kommission 1900–), and are susceptible of change against corpus-based evidence. This work in progress is available at our website (http://woposs.unil.ch/semantic-modal-maps.php). Updates refining the visualization and/or adding more semantic maps are frequent. As part of the future work, we envisage the implementation of additional features: we plan to employ motion to visualise the modal path of a specific marker interacting with its chronological attestations. Also, we are conscious of the challenges that discernity of color entails for people with visual disabilities, thus we want to avoid the use of color as the only visual means of conveying certain information. Therefore, we plan to combine it with other visual cues, like texture. In addition, the size will be customizable and color contrast will be checked.7The visualisations currently available were developed using Inkscape8 to create the basic SVG that will be enhanced by manually including the animation elements with a combination of JavaScript and CSS. The selection of open-source software guarantees an open development. Therefore, not only the results, but all the data and methods will be made publicly available, thus contributing to both the Open Data movement and Public Digital Humanities.Even if the core of our work concerns Latin modality, the principles and techniques presented can be easily applied to any other language. We claim this model to be versatile: it would be useful to researchers, but also appropriate for vehiculating complex semantic concepts in an educational environment thanks to its readability and immediacy. Besides its possible implementation with languages other than Latin, any type of semantic shift could be visualised following our template. Semantic maps aid in the understanding of meaning so any fields working with natural language, like history or philology, would benefit from our results.","helena.bermudezsabel@unil.ch, francesca.delloro@unil.ch, paola.marongiu@unil.ch",Poster

Discourse and algorithms become a technique to exercise power, for example through “nudging” strategic behaviour and thereby shaping labour, both physical and mental. Through behavioural logics of control our everyday lives are subject to algorithmic management from increasingly prevalent hyper-individualised capillaries of power. These implications are increasingly discussed in the media and in politics, particularly in relation to a future dominated by technologies which are thought to have huge social consequences. These are important issues, but here I drill down to focus on the cognitive and explanatory issues in relation to the digital humanities. In the first half of the paper, I seek to think critically about the concept of explainability and its potential for developing a possible tactic in response to the wider toxicity generated by algorithmic governance. The aim is to offer an immanent critique of the notion of explainability. By immanent critique, I refer to an approach whereby the internal terms and concepts within a system are examined in relation to the reality of the claims they make about and the actuality of the world. In the second half of the paper I seek to show how these claims about explainability can and should be taken up by digital humanities as an explicitly interdisciplinary theoretical concern for a new research programme in the digital humanities. I argue that the justificatory move to explainability as a panacea for computational systems is therefore an important diagnostic site for interrogating their power and ubiquity. One of the most difficult tasks facing the digital humanist today is understanding the delegation and prescription of agency in digital infrastructures. It is clear that in the context of computational systems, the first important question we need to consider is what counts as an explanation? Indeed, explanations are generally considered to be able to tell us how things work and thereby giving us the power to change our environment in order to meet our own ends. In this sense of explanation then, science is often supposed to be the best means of generating explanations. So, with a stress on the importance of explanation, explainability makes it a criterion of adequacy for satisfactory use of algorithmic decision systems, and thereby legitimating their use in a multitude of settings. Thus, explainability and the underlying explanation are linked to the question of justification. I call this the “Explainability Turn.” It is a genuinely interesting question as to the extent to which explainability will be able to mitigate the public anxieties manifested when confronted with opaque automated decision systems. The scale of the challenge represented by the requirement to provide an explanation seems to me to be under-appreciated, and clearing the theoretical ground for even thinking about this problem cannot be overstated. So, what then is an explanation? Hempel and Oppenheim (1988) argue that an explanation seeks to “exhibit and to clarify in a more rigorous manner”. Some of the examples they give include, a mercury thermometer which has been rapidly immersed in hot water and whole temperature reading can be explained using physical properties of the glass and mercury. An explanation therefore attempts to explain with reference to general laws. However, this causal mode of explanation can become inadequate in fields concerned with purposive behaviour, as with computational systems. In this case it is common for reference to purposive behaviour, such as in so-called machine behaviour, to be given in relation to “motivations” and therefore for teleological rather than causal explanation. Thus, the goals sought by the system are required in order to provide an explanation. Teleological approaches to explanation may also make us feel that we really understand a phenomenon because it is accounted for in terms of purposes, with which we are familiar from our own experience of purposive behaviour. One can, therefore, see a great temptation to use teleological explanation in relation to AI systems, particularly by creating a sense of an empathetic understanding of the “personalities of the agents.” In relation to explanation, therefore, explainability can be said to aim to provide an answer to the question “why?” The concept of explainability, and the related practices of designing and building explainable systems, also have an underlying theory of general explainability and a theory of the human mind. These two theories are rarely explicitly articulated in the literature, and I want to bring them together to interrogate how explainability cannot be a mere technical response to the contemporary problem of automated decision systems, but actually requires philosophical investigation to be properly placed within its historical and conceptual milieu. Additionally, explanation is ambiguous as it may refer to the product or to a process. It certainly seems to be the case that many discussions of explainability tend to be chiefly interested in the idea of an explanatory product. Thus, an “explanatory product” can be characterised solely in terms of the kind of information it conveys, no reference to the act of explaining being required. The question therefore becomes, what information has to be conveyed in order to have explained something? This is something I argue that the digital humanities are well-qualified to develop as a research programme. For the user to challenge an explanation or appeal to a higher authority, if it were considered inadequate, requires expertise that presently is not readily available. I argue that digital humanities should become exemplars in the development of such systems, and by doing so contribute to a public humanities that seeks to provide knowledge and support outside of academia in relation to furthering and deepening knowledge of, and critique for, explainable systems.

This looked at how digital transformations were remaking what we think of as knowledge formed in and through the university over time. Part of the outcomes of that project was funding for the ØxØ project as a sonic installation. This included looking at how concepts, organisation and computation are formed into a new constellation of power and knowledge. This work examines how these systems are legitimated and the orders of justification around them, together with the potential of exemplar concepts such as “utility” for providing immanent critique and the space for practices of critical reason. In this research we have started to describe this new form of university as a data-intensive university, one that is increasingly challenged by a data-centric economy and polity. Associational modes of thinking are particularly encouraged through concepts of streaming, surfing, or algorithmic reverie. The possibility of thought is thereby prescribed by a net of software that surrounds and envelopes the mind, creating a new topology of attention. In this research the university, in its work in the creation of critical reason is argued to be a key, if not the key, institution to contest these developments. We explore that these shifting social, political and economic forces that call for a new distinctive role for the university through a method of sonification that works through concepts immanent to the university represented through sound. But the research also raises new questions for the university: How do the academic disciplines respond, what are the implications for their teaching and research? What are the implications for the wider university? What will be the pattern or shape of this new university? It has been argued that the chapel and the library are no longer the centre of a university, so where is the centre of the university in a data-intensive age? This poster documents the processes and conceptual work undertaken in this research and the eventual final audio and visual materials that have been produced.

On the collective creation of a corpus exploration toolMaria Biryukov, Roman Kalyakin, Eva Andersen, Lars WienekeIntroductionAs described elsewhere we conducted a probing exercise that brought together a historian and a computer scientist to cooperatively explore a research corpus. With the idea to find and trace the evolution of psychiatric knowledge, the team analysed the British Journal of Psychiatry over a timespan of more than 70 years, consisting of 51k pages and covering a wide range of content types such as articles, book reviews, asylum reports, membership lists, etc. A particular challenge was the lack of coherence in the corpus: no logical units such as article boundaries and mediocre OCR quality restricted the direct application of topic modelling and other NLP techniques to a subset of articles through existing tools like MALLET.The team chose to tackle this challenge by applying topic modelling in order to give structure to the corpus and detect relevant segments for historical analysis. After splitting the corpus into individual pages and applying other preprocessing steps, the team used Non-negative Matrix Factorization to decompose the corpus into topics per year, assign words to the topics and to score the individual documents/pages. We then evaluated the optimal number of topics using human evaluation as well as a Word2Vec corpus model for topic coherence calculation. To enable a diachronic perspective on the corpus we applied dynamic topic modelling to the annual topics. Close inspection of the outcomes made it apparent to the historian that the approach enabled the discovery of weak signals and hidden information that were not easily accessible through conventional approaches.However, we came to the understanding that a more in-depth historical analysis required a higher degree of autonomy for the historian, as well as facilities allowing multiple perspectives on the data and better ways to present and interact with it. This insight and the potential for a generalisable application convinced us to advance from a probing exercise to building a tool that empowers historians to query, review and explore datasets with a high degree of autonomy and direct access that doesn’t require additional mediation.Building an interface for autonomy and empowermentDue to the conceptual similarity and availability, we decided to adapt HistoGraph a tool initially designed for the graph based exploration of multimedia collections. One of the decisive features of HistoGraph and a strong rationale for integrating our corpus in the tool is found in its drill-down capabilities: all analytical perspectives always lead back to the sources, enabling the researcher to confirm or refute the results of the computational analysis on a case by case basis.We first performed a named entity extraction task using a combination of Flair’s ‘ner-fast’ model for entity recognition and Google Knowledge Graph for disambiguation.[4] Because of mediocre OCR quality and the historical nature of the corpus, we decided to boost the quality of the entity extraction by aligning the entities with a specialised dataset of historical actors in the domain of psychiatry using a basic string comparison approach. While we initially hoped that the process would yield interpretable network structures, a critical review of the results showed that generic NED models are by design too “contemporary” to successfully identify historical actors and produce meaningful results – an issue we aim to address in the future.To enable a meaningful perspective on the topic modelling described above, we decided to integrate a new view in histograph that shows a full perspective on the corpus with the ability to “zoom in” on selected parts. In this new view, pages are displayed in sequential order and aggregated in “buckets” of equal size, containing a different number of pages depending on the chosen zoom level. Buckets are displayed as clickable columns in the interface, while topics are displayed in the form of an aggregated heat map of topic distributions across the corpus (Figure 1). While working with the historian it became apparent that additional layers would facilitate the corpus exploration, e.g. through adding full-text search capability that presents an aggregated view of text hits across the corpus within the individual buckets.Collective development and explorationOf vital importance during our experiments was the constant feedback between the team members. Our discussions led to the insight that more analytical lenses are necessary to better explore the corpus because complex research questions can often not be captured by a single analytical perspective. In consequence, different layers were added such as the ability to map the results of a keyword search across the corpus. In consequence the pipeline allowed us to discover more relevant content. Our preliminary evaluation compared existing research on the same corpus with our results and we were able to find the same sources as identified by analogue ToC analysis as well as to identify relevant content in other sections that were not accessible through the ToC. For one particular research question — the discussion of the causes of general paralysis in the psychiatric community — this approach proved to be a powerful exploration tool. The extent to which this approach would work on other research questions needs to be explored further and in more detail but looks quite promising.Brainstorming on this challenge led to the development of an “auto-complete query” feature that builds on the distribution of words in the corpus to refine queries. Initially we used the Word2Vec background model to expand seed terms specified by the researcher. The resulting query was used in the full-text search mode. However, it became apparent that a full-text search based on the constructed query would, from a historians’ point of view, lead to a too restricted number of results leaving out promising source material. Looking at this challenge from a computer science perspective, we noticed that the constructed query can be regarded as a vector in the word2vec model that allows to identify documents that are closely related to it, effectively enabling a custom topic for the exploration of the corpus. In close cooperation the team reviewed the feasibility of the approach and ultimately integrated the feature to allow for a more specific yet flexible analysis.Conclusion and future workThe project started out as a highly dynamic, small scale exploration in the use of topic modelling for structuring an unstructured corpus. Based on the results of this exercise our work was shaped by ongoing discussions between the team members that lead to a co-construction process which not only yielded a new and – as we hope – generalisable tool for the exploration of unstructured or semi-structured corpora, but also shaped the perspectives of the individual team members: by discussing the different approaches used to develop a meaningful interface it allowed the historian an insight into the technology that was used and vice versa enriched the perspective of the computer science colleagues by gaining a deeper understanding of how historians work.

These platforms extend opportunities for political actors especially political parties, governmenta and citizens to engage directly to build mutually beneficial relationships through engagements ans interactions. Using interviews and content analysis, this article explores “Twittering” in political communication and engagements; how political parties use social media especially during their 2018 intra-party elections in Ghana. It examines how the New Patriotic Party and National Democratic Congress in Ghana use Twitter in intra-party elections. The article gathers data from political parties and their Twitter pages to theorize the political appropriation of social media in Ghana.The findings show that the political parties minimally appropriate Twitter; as they occasionally used it for public information purposes than interactive engagements and mutually beneficial relationships via two-way symmetrical communication. There were insignificant amount of tweet made by the political parties during their intra-party elections in 2018, which indicate that political use of social media in Ghana is still infantile. Therefore, political parties need to improve their use of Twitter and other social media platforms to take maxim advantage of the interactive features and relationship building potentials to garner support from the public and votes in elections. In this regard, political parties require enlightenEd communication strategies and professional political public relations tact for improved use to mature in social media communication.",beebeeboateng@gmail.com,Poster

Nearly half a million-people had to go into mass exile during the months of January and February, through the French border crossings. Many other exiles did so, months later, from Alicante to the North African coasts. These places of destination were, in most cases, places of passage to successive destination countries in Europe and, especially, in Latin America. The international nature of this historical event means that there is currently a large number of personal files scattered in different places around the world. In order to recover these stories, the e-xiliad@s project was conceived in 2009, with a Digital Humanities and Public History perspective: www.exiliadosrepublicanos.info. It is an crowdsourcing project that, through a multilanguage digital platform, retrieves unpublished documents about the anonymous exiled. From the research point of view, the privileged target audience is composed by relatives and friends of the exiles and those interested in the subject. This initiative funded twice (2009 and 2011) by the General Directorate of Migrations of the Spanish Ministry of Employment and Social Security, uses a methodology created ad hoc to obtaining data based on public participation from citizen science. That is, the content is generated on-line by the public at an international level and coordinated by a scientific specialist. For almost a decade, this crowdsourcing project has been developing an online public engagement strategy for public participation based on open data, supported by a custom digital platform and its digital social networks, with more than 1.500 followers. At this stage, the project recovered around five hundred unpublished archives among photographs, memories, official documents, letters and interviews, that comes associated with about two hundred completed exile records. The vast majority of these data are public, thanks to the informed consent of the author.Figure 1. Examples of documents and photos provided by relatives of exiles registered on the project platform and collaborators.At technological level, e-xiliad@s has been built using Drupal 6 LTS (Long Term Support) with a MySQL database. The technological solution answer the need of the internal survey form that has been created using a specific data model connected with a strategic communication plan, that serves to get data online via user’ confidence with the project and to stimulate his/her family memoir.Figure 2. Detail of the internal form to be filledAs lesson learned, the need to maintain a technology that is getting older without official support (Drupal); the management of a project social network community continuously growing; and the spamming problem due to the project popularity within the republican exile community (more than 11.000 spamming users) are questions that we are trying to solve. Despite this, E-xiliad@s acts as a digital identity place for those connected to this topic and as a space that informs society, with scientific rigor, from the field of Digital Public History. Currently there are six large online social network communities that move much of the information on the subject of Republican exile and the Spanish Civil War, among which is the e-xiliad@s project with its social networks (Facebook: @exiliados.republicanos and Twitter: @exiliadas.

In the spirit of a key theme of DH2020---Public Digital Humanities---our presentation will consider what happens when we as researchers instead empower people to design their own DH tools according to their (perhaps idiosyncratic) purposes.With our project, ""Poetry Machines,"" we are recruiting individual poets who are not themselves programmers or machine learning practitioners to design their own artificially intelligent tools that will assist or challenge them in the middle of the writing process.This research takes the approach of ""participatory design"". We have composed a design guide, a ""boundary object"" providing a way for the poets to design their own poetry machines by combining various basic text processing functions and machine learning techniques into complex interfaces. We will then build these interfaces to their specifications, working with them collaboratively to further refine and develop designs (for instance, by presenting options of how a particular wished-for feature could be implemented).A few possible functions that such machines could perform (the first two drawing from our own research [Booten 2019; Gero and Chilton 2019]): provide stylistic advice, e.g. alert the writer when she has used highly common lexico-semantic patterns or descriptors (e.g. 'glowing' to describe 'moon')replace a word with a synonym that is characteristic of a particular author. whenever the writer pauses for too long, complete the line with a neural networkOur design guide provides the poet with substantial flexibility in terms of how the Poetry Machine is activated (for instance, randomly vs. after every line), how it intervenes (for instance, adding to the poem or displaying information in a sidebar), and how machine learning models are trained (for instance, a neural network trained on Romantic vs. modernist poetry).Our research goals are to determine: 1) whether different sorts of poets (e.g. formalists vs. more experimental writers) make different design choices, 2) whether the machines meet their design expectations, and 3) whether this process provides the poets opportunity to develop critical perspectives on machine learning itself. Having acquired institutional approval to solicit poets for formal research, we are in the process of engaging poets in the participatory design process, and our presentation will offer preliminary findings.This work intervenes in several DH fields:Though we are inspired by key examples of aesthetically-experimental hermeneutic interfaces, our research will be of interest to DH tool designers more broadly, especially those interested in ""bespoke"" tool.""Electronic literature"" is part of DH. Programmer-poets often design their own tools for algorithmic co-writing (e.g. Johnston's [2019] neural-network assisted ReRites).

Yet, despite rare initiatives, transcriptions are scarcely shared with other researchers. And their annotation is most of the time done only for a personal use, without following any sort of standard, and not meant to be shown to anyone.In this paper, we advocate for the necessity of a more open management of these resources, and present a proposition for a XML-TEI-conformant standard, allowing for their accurate transcription and annotation. The ODD we present is aimed at facilitating systematic analyses of corpora of interview transcriptions, as well as at ensuring a better dissemination and re-usability of these resources. We rely as much as possible on existing TEI elements, but introduce a new element and a new attribute, to address the specificities of this kind of materials.Interviews: a precious resourceFiguratively and literally, interview transcriptions are a precious resource. Producing them comes at a high cost: researchers must dedicate a lot of time and money to organize the interviews, travel, speak with the interviewees and transcribe the interviews. They should thus be used and re-used to their fullest potential. Finding a way to properly encoding them will help further qualitative or quantitative analyses by the researcher as well as by other colleagues taking interest in the source. Sharing effectively these resources would allow for comparisons between results obtained by researchers from various disciplines, at different periods and places, or to build larger corpora to obtain new results.Addressing the reproducibility crisisHuman and social sciences have been targeted by many critics during the “replication crisis” controversy. Research relying on qualitative analyses are not easily subject to the same reproducibility assessment, but should in many cases allow for “comparative re-production”: in a similar context, and following the same principles and questioning, will a new interview lead to results comparable to the ones previously made? Making one’s transcriptions and annotations available would be a way to make this possible. It would also ensure that conclusions drawn from an interview are trusted, as a reviewer, colleague, or reader in general, could access the annotations underlying the researcher’s analyses.A standard adaptable by each research communityWe propose to create an ODD (One Document Does It All), setting out which TEI elements and associated attributes can be used and in which context, and documenting our choices to future users. An ODD also enables to add new elements and attributes. And within a given community, it is possible to agree on an available ODD customization that will ensure the interoperability, shareability and reusability of the TEI files. To create this ODD, we mostly combine the elements and attributes declared by the modules “Transcription of Speech” and “Language Corpora”, and propose to add one new element and one new attribute.Ethics and respect of privacy A key concern in sharing qualitative interviews should be the respect of legal constraints and ethics principles. We thus propose the creation of a new element, to annotate passages that could not be freely shared. This element allows for a description of the deleted passage and the reason for its deletion. It is meant to ensure the protection of interviewees, while concealing as little relevant information as possible.The creation of this new element relies on TEI best practices, and draws on the use of the element <damage>, employed to encode the damages done to a primary sources - for example by indicating that some text is lacking, and by supplying the lacking part with alternate text. The new element <privacy> works in the same way to mention that a passage has been deleted and why it has been deleted. As well as the <damage> element, <privacy> bears attributes such as “unit”, “quantity” and “extent” to precise the length of the deletion. The reason of the deletion could then be expressed within an attribute “reason”, more suitable in this context than the attribute “agent” born by <damage>. An element <desc> enclosed in the element <privacy> gives also more information on the causes of the deletion (legal reasons, ethics code, personal moral judgement). We also propose an alternate encoding strategy by enclosing a <gap> element within <privacy> to provide more information on the deletion. Moreover if the transcriber wishes to replace the deleted passage - e.g., replacing the name of a person with a pseudonym for ease of reading -, he or she may also use a <supplied> element enclosed within <privacy>.Reflecting on one’s interview practicesThe <u> element is used to encode the different parts of speech given by the interviewers and the interviewees, with a “who” attribute to express who is the speaker. But qualitative interviews are not ordinary conversations: they are prepared by a researcher, implementing a strategy to get as much information as possible on a topic of interest. It is thus crucial to encode the researcher’s comments on its own speech (Beaud, 1996): was the question prepared? spontaneous? what was its purpose (changing the subject/knowing more/confirming a previous statement etc.) ? This is why we propose to add a “type” attribute to the list of already existing attributes born by <u>, describing this kind of information.Annotating the interview: sharing one’s interpretationIn addition to simple content annotations (persons or places cited, dates evoked etc.), our model offers the possibility of sharing one’s interpretations about relevant passages of the transcription.We propose to use the <seg> element bearing an “xml:id” attribute to delimit the parts of the speech that are in need of further analyses. These analyses can then be provided via a <span> element bearing a “target” attribute to identify which <seg> element is concerned, and a “type” attribute to express the nature of this analyses. The <interpr> element may be used in conjunction with the <span> element, but <interpr> is more suitable to identify various parts of speeches under unique conceptual categories. Associating identified parts of speeches and specific conceptual categories is easy with TEI pointer mechanisms: for example, an “ana” attribute born by a <seg> element enables to associate this element with an <interp> element bearing an “xml:id” attribute.","florian.cafiero@gmail.com, marie.puren@cnrs.fr",Short Presentation

Previous studies (Scheufele and Tewksbury 2006; Yunjuan et al. 2019; Wanta and Ghanem 2006) suggest that the capacity of media to influence the salience of issues depends on four parameters, namely: (1) obtrusiveness; (2) duration; (3) abstractness; and (4) dramatism. Soroka (2002) built upon these parameters by developing an issue typology:Prominent issues affect a relevant number of people directly (e.g. the rise of salaries) and are thought to leave little room for media impact on public opinion.Sensational issues are initiated by a dramatic event (e.g. a kidnapping) but have little observable impact on the everyday life of the majority of the population.Governmental issues are perceived as abstract or as not having direct effect on people's lives (e.g. public debt) and do not offer dramatic or exciting components.Assuming the validity of Soroka's typology, we ask whether and how issue-types give rise to different life patterns of news stories.We thus identify three measurable dimensions: (a.) lifespan (i.e., the number of days over which articles of a news story are published); (b.) intensity (i.e., the number of articles per day per story); and (c.) burstiness (i.e., the speed with which stories go from emerging to their climax).We collected a corpus of 50,385 political articles from major Spanish newspapers in 2018. News stories were generated by aggregating articles with K-means clustering. For each week, we identified the number of clusters (i.e. stories) using the elbow method (k ranging between 1 and 30), and removed general clusters using silhouette analysis.A subset of the clusters was evaluated against manually labeled data by checking the extent to which clusters contain a single class (i.e., purity), obtaining a score of 0.87. Afterwards, we assigned each story to one issue-type.The quantitative dimensions show that the issue-types differentiate only to some extent. Sensational stories have the highest intensity, shortest lifespan, and highest burstiness (i.e., they appear “out of the blue”). Prominent stories last for long periods (14 days on average) but have low intensity and burstiness, i.e. they slowly grow to their climax. Governmental stories lay in the middle between these two latter: they are similar to Sensational stories in intensity, and to Prominent stories in lifespan. However, their burstiness score suggests variations in the speed of growth.Figure 1 visualizes the patterns of the stories aggregated by type[1]: sensational stories have one climax event and long falling actions, while Prominent stories may have multiple climax events. The different typologies seem to instantiate different plot structures (Bal 1997).The results of our empirical analysis indicate that different issue-types exhibit different behaviors when represented as news stories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to operationalize Soroka's framework in a digital approach. Future research will pursue understanding the capacity of media agents to define public agenda through timing.Our approach is language independent and can be applied to study news issue-types across media platforms and countries[2].Lifecycle patterns for type of news storyFigure 1: All the stories of our corpus are plotted with its climax in 0 (transparent lines).

We will consider ethical scenarios through specific projects of the SpokenWeb partnership, a research network that aims to develop coordinated and collaborative approaches to literary historical study, digital development, and critical and pedagogical engagement with diverse collections of literary sound recordings from across Canada and beyond. The goals and projects of the SpokenWeb partnership that will serve to focus our discussion of ethical scenarios in large-scale collaborative digital humanities networks include:1. rights and access management of digital research data and metadata;2. the ethics of archival listening as they pertain to the development of new forms of historicaland critical scholarly methods of engagement with the contents of documentary audio Archives; 3. automated techniques and tools for searching, visualizing, analyzing and enhancing criticalengagement (for features relevant to humanities research and pedagogy);4. pedagogy, training, mentorship and student labor (the organization of roles and relationsacross the research network);5. innovative ways of mobilizing digitized spoken and literary recordings within performative andpublic contexts;6. project management and governance.[Figure 1. Mainpage of SpokenWeb Research Site]To date, the proposed SpokenWeb archive contains approximately 5000 hours, or 12Tb, of audio data. The SpokenWeb program begins with the preservation and description of sonic artifacts that have captured literary events of the past, and quickly moves into a wide range of approaches and activities activate these artifacts in the present. For the purpose of this set of presentations that will use SpokenWeb projects as case studies for the consideration of ethical scenarios in digital humanities research programs, the authors intend a forward-looking focus that emerges from the fact that research and teaching with literary audio on this scale promises the possibility of paradigmPanelProposal for DH2020 shifting engagement with audio objects that have been, by and large, beyond the consideration of methodologies central to the discipline of literary studies and beyond the primary concerns of research librarians and archivists. An exciting dimension of SpokenWeb is the collaborative enterprise of digital humanists, cultural scholars, literary scholars, archivists, librarians, and sound technicians coming together to generate questions and solve problems beyond the capacity of any one of those fields of expertise. Such an undertaking invites the revisioning of processes of technical development, preservation and access strategies, metadata and systems coordination, rights management, pedagogical methods, student research and training, events curation and community outreach, and overarching concerns of project management and governance. With such revisioning comes the opportunity and responsibility to consider, or reconsider, the ethical dimensions of each set of project activities.Our proposal to explore ethical case study scenarios in relation to SpokenWeb research activities, approached as a multi-authored work with representatives from different constituencies of our research partnership, stems from the governance structure of the network. The governance structure is designed to provide representation of the key research areas of the SpokenWeb network, namely, literary methods, data and metadata, computational analysis, pedagogy and training, community outreach and events, and reserves additional positions for student representation. We will make use of this structure to organize the papers comprising our presentation, and will conclude with some framing observations about the important function of project management and governance in relation to the ethical scenarios discussed.Paper 1“Ethical Considerations of Rights, Access and Metadata Management of Digital Audio Assets”Annie Murray (University of Calgary) and Jason Camlot (Concordia University)Determining the rights holder for an archival audio recording can present challenges to archivists and researchers alike. In many cases, collections of audio recordings may have scant labelling on them, and in many archival collections, descriptive information may be at a basic level. Normally, physical examination of the cassette can yield some information about the possible rights holder; however, listening to the digitized recordings can bring about a fuller awareness of the specific copyright information needed to pursue permissions. The individual or organization who made a given recording is in most cases the rights holder. That is to say that the speaker or reader on the recording is in many cases not the rights holder. To what extent might the speaker or performer be informed of or involved in the permissions process for a recording? How would an institutional archive approach rights management compared to an artist-centred community? Rights management must transcend legal documents and procedures, and take into account relationships amongst archival, library, researcher, and literary stakeholders. Since our project intends eventually to provide open public access to this entire body of recordings, rights management activities need to take into account affective and ethical considerations that arise in order to ethically share archival recordings. Rights and permissions management of time-based media assets that document historical performances and speech acts of individuals before and within communities of the past demands engagement with the implications of replaying such events within communities of the present.In addition to such considerations surrounding the determination of permissions and access gradations for documentary audio recordings, we have been interested in reflecting upon the ethical implications of the nature and use of the descriptive metadata that we have produced and will continue to produce for the audio assets of the collections we are developing. During the first year of the SpokenWeb research program, a Metadata Task Force worked to develop a unique (yet linked) metadata schema for the description of documentary literary and humanities-oriented sound recordings held in both institutional and community-based collections. The schema is used by all team members to describe collections across the country. Interesting ethical questions have arisen both in relation to the establishment of specific metadata categories, and for the larger question concerning the degree to which the metadata we are producing should be made publicly accessible. Fields such as Genre, Content, and Statement of Responsibility have raised interesting questions about the impact of disciplinary presuppositions (in the case of genre), transcription (in the case of content) and definitions of “authorship” and communities of production (in the case of responsibility). We will identify and propose parameters of discussion for these three examples of metadata production and the ethical issues they raise. Finally, we will describe some pointed ethical scenarios pertaining to the use of metadata once it has been collected and made ready to share. While our first position has been (and remains, in principle) to make all SpokenWeb metadata open, we feel it is worth exploring possibilities and scenarios in which the descriptive metadata we are producing about documentary sound recordings may itself raise questions of ethical disclosure. While the argument that the open sharing of the descriptive metadata we produce should, legally, be allowable because such information consists of descriptive and reported facts about artifacts that are linked to, yet separate in substance from, the artifacts that may be subject to more complicated rights requirements, ethical questions remain concerning whether the parties that are captured in documentary audio collections wish their past activities, associations and locations to be known and be made publicly accessible through openly shared data that is designed to be linked and discoverable. For example, description of events that make intensive use of VIAF and Wikidata to establish association links between scenes and individuals, without details concerning the nature of past associations, may raise issues about what Erving Goffman once referred to as “Stigma management” in the present. Paper 2“Closer Listening: or, beyond the ‘anonymity of a murmur’”Deanna Fong (Concordia University), Michael O’Driscoll (University of Alberta)“We can easily imagine a culture where discourse would circulate without any need for an author. Discourses, whatever their status, form or value, and regardless of our manner of handling them, would unfold in the anonymity of a murmur.”Foucault, “What is an Author?”When Michel Foucault conceived of an archaeology of knowledge, predicated on the emergence of “statements” that, as Giorgio Agamben famously challenges in the archival ethics of his Remnants of Auschwitz, are events void of subjectivity, or when Foucault simultaneously contended for the death of the author as a mere subject-function unnecessary to the circulation of literature, he could hardly have imagined a vast digital archive of poetic discourse comprised entirely of the recorded voices of successive generations of creative writers. Amongst its many multi-disciplinary implications, the SpokenWeb Project promises, in moving from page to stage, a paradigm-shifting invitation to consider the digital audiotext as a fundamental medium of literary-historical analysis. In turning our attention from the printed, written text to the voiced performance, the SpokenWeb archive not only prompts new methodological questions for literary analysis, it also insists upon a revived relationship to the human being occupying the reanimated subject-position of “author.” Indeed, the audio objects at the centre of this collective enterprise—with their haunting disjointedness of the voice’s spectral presence—pose pressing questions of relation—of ethical relation, obligation, inheritance, and responsibility—between speaker and listener.This paper moves toward, or contends for, an ethics that is predicated on listening as intentional and affirmative of the speaker's embodied subjectivity—how we might listen to and for the grain of voice, the breath, the murmur, the semiotic rather than symbolic articulations of body—the openness of which runs counter to the hermeneutics of suspicion that governs conventional practices of textual analysis. As Mladen Dolar contends in A Voice and Nothing More: “The voice can be located at the juncture of the subject and the Other, just as it was before, in a different register, placed at the intersection of body and language, circumscribing a lack in both.” The speaker’s embodied subjectivity, foregrounded in the audio artifact, also points us to a set of material questions that have to do with the medium’s “counter-affordances” as a register of public speech. What can and can’t be said on the record, and by whom? Here, we argue that while audio recordings open us up to the stochastic noise of live speech and performance that these are also disciplined by the act of recording, and that this discipline unevenly applied to different subjects based on their relation to dominant power. In this manner, an ethics of archiving digital audio must also consider the material gaps and silences that exist within individual artifacts (in the form of cuts and edits, self-censorship, and muted or inaudible voices) as much as within larger collections (representation, institutional prioritization, preservation practices, etc.) “Automated Annotation, Metadata Production, and Scenarios of Difficult Content”Tanya Clement (University of Texas at Austin), Liz Fischer (University of Texas at Austin)Audio Visual collections, even when digitized, are difficult to search and analyze. Often, AV comes with limited metadata. Consequently, information professionals have to listen to items in real time and add information for indexing. Since enhancing searching, visualizing, and analyzing audio collections is often reliant on some level of metadata, an item that has not been vetted will often remain “hidden”. Libraries and archives, after all, are not want to make cultural heritage items that might potentially have privacy or security issues openly available online. In such cases, libraries have begun to consider using machine learning and other means of automatically generating metadata. Automatically generating metadata introduces ethical concerns, however. Jen Guiliano and CarolynHeitman use the term “difficult heritage” to explore “the aggregation of cultural records related to colonialism and its impacts on Native peoples” in their desire to “reconcile concerns of documenting the past with the need to confront the genocidal practices from which most of these records result”. In the context of SpokenWeb, such concerns are also relevant, though differently oriented. Many of the recordings include well-known poets such as Allen Ginsberg, Robert Creeley, and Muriel Rukeyser, but these poets also appear in recordings of panels or in the context of classroom encounters where unknown or unnamed voices also linger. Further, speakers may use language that is flippant or unconcerned at best or offensive at worst about topics such as race or gender in ways that are not reflective of more current perspectives and conversations. These incongruities are not new; they have always been part of our difficult heritage, but this discussion will articulate which ethical concerns have come to the fore when we use machines to ingest, sort, analyze, and represent sensitive materials in audio collections. A substantial proportion (~67%) of SpokenWeb SSHRC Partnership funding is dedicated to graduate and undergraduate students, whose training and research contributions to the SpokenWeb partnership form a core part of our mandate. The SpokenWeb Pedagogy Task Force has viewed this as an opportunity to develop mentorship and supervision best practices, building upon those outlined in “The Student Collaborators Bill of Rights” and with attention to findings and recommendations of “Student Labour and Training in the Digital Humanities” (Anderson et al). The integration of students into a large-scale digital humanities research network raises some key questions regarding mentorship, training, and graduate vs undergraduate student labour. For instance: what counts as “work” on SpokenWeb? How do we describe work the students are doing? Is it possible to ensure practices around student labour are addressed with consistency across the SpokenWeb network of Canadian and US American institutions? What kinds of iterative conversations are necessary to ensure work is meaningful to students? Murphy and Shearer consider the organization of roles and relations across the research network, with particular attention to the role of undergraduate trainees. What kinds of ethical issues emerge when involving undergraduate trainees in research roles?Anderson, Katrina and Lindsey Bannister, Janey Dodd, Deanna Fong, Michelle Levy, Lindsey Seatter. “Student Labour and Training in the Digital Humanities.” Digital Humanities Quarterly 10.1http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000233/000233.htmlStone, Sandy.

Positioned as mediator between authors and audience, however, the literary curator accepts, by default, a radical responsibility towards both the authors they represent and towards the audience they expose to literary performance. Both as historical or archival study and as continued praxis for contemporary literary events, poetry reading curation hinges on an ethical discussion of relational dynamics as manifested in literary dissemination. This paper takes two pairs of scenarios--each comprised of one archival and one recent experiential example--to frame the ethical concerns surrounding the curation of literary events.As a first case study, du Plessis follows the digital audio archives of Véhicule Art Inc--a bilingual, interdisciplinary artists’ run centre and exhibition space that hosted a weekly poetry reading series and quarterly open mic marathon events in Montreal, 1972-1983--as well as experimental, contemporary Deep Curation readings--an approach which places poets’ work in deliberate dialogue with each other and heightens the curator’s agency toward the poetic product. As a curatorial strategy, the former prioritizes a self-conscious preference for literary novelty and unrestrained openness, offering all agency to the authors as to what they present to the audience. Arguably, this (along with a wide range of cultural and sociological factors inherent to the 1970s in North America) frequently results in an unfiltered performance of sexist, misogynist, rhetoric; this work often signals sexually violent content, especially, when mapped onto a contemporary listening audience. As a corrective, a Deep Curational approach scripts exactly what the authors will present, creating a thematic and theoretical framing for the reading, while also retaining curatorial agency for the curator. Although authors consent to this process, dynamics of agency between curator and authors undergo a radical shift as the curator now enacts an authorial role.As a second case study, Camlot presents brief examples from SpokenWeb’s first “Performing the Archive” series, developed by staging public readings in which poets who read in Montreal as part of the Sir George Williams Poetry Series (1965-1974) return to read alongside their past archival selves. The illustrative examples in this case will include events involving Daphne Marlatt, Diane Wakoski, George Bowering and David McFadden. Mixing live reading with readings from the archive results in an affective performance of the relationship between the modes and meanings of performance in a past cultural and sociological context and the present one. Further as the live reader stands silently on stage while the archival clips are played, it also renders the act of listening a mode of visible performance for the audience. Such performances function as a lo-fi versions of what Steven Benford and Gabriella Giannachi have described as acts of “performing mixed reality.” Staging listening to the archive as a form of live performance can also be understood to open a temporal portal (to use a term from Wolfgang Ernst) between two ethico-cultural moments, and incites reflection upon the meaning of literary performance in different historical contexts. Each “Performing the Archive” event is followed by a period of discussion that explores the meaning of the temporal encounter that such a curated performance involving archival audio, entails, and, inevitably, raises interesting questions about the ethics of activating archives in distinctive, performative ways, and the different aesthetic and ethical meaning of literary performance in changing historical contexts.Beneford, Steve, and Gabriella Giannachi.

Take librarians, for example. On the one hand, they have a duty of loyalty to their own institution when performing their functional role. On the other hand, when serving in their role as a member of a research project (as a member of the Governing Board or a project-oriented Task Force), they may be asked to reconsider, reexamine or reshape policies and procedures that they have been hired to uphold in their institutional role. The project manager in such a scenario ends up enabling and perhaps even inciting a conflict-of-interest situation, which represents a conflict-of-interest in itself, for the project manager, as it undermines a key ethical principle of the PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.[Figure 2. SpokenWeb Network and Governance Diagram]The establishment of a well designed governance structure can help to mitigate such scenarios of conflict of interest (and other forms of conflict). By identifying core features of the constituencies involved in the research program, ensuring representation of those constituencies on the Governing Board, and Task Forces, and especially by collaboratively establishing guideline and process documents that may be referred to for decision making in areas that represent regular points of tension between the goals of a network project, and the goals of a participating institutional or community partner, scenarios of conflict can be managed in such a way that they do not undermine the advancement of project aims, and to the satisfaction of the interests of the partner. Importantly, creating scenarios for collective reflection upon the complexity of our loyalties and relationships is a productive approach. Staging discussions about agreed upon methods of collaboration -- for example, the use of cross institutional Task Forces designed to advance specific goals -- is a useful and neutral way to reflect upon the effects of institutional loyalties in relation to shared goals of the research program. This paper presents scenarios of such conflict and resolution for consideration and discussion.","jason.camlot@concordia.ca, tclement@utexas.edu, klaraduplessis@gmail.com, lfisher@austin.utexas.edu, deanna.m.fong@gmail.com, yuliya.kondratenko@concordia.ca, emurph01@mail.ubc.ca, amurr@ucalgary.ca, mo@ualberta.ca, karis.shearer@ubc.ca",Panel

Swallow, the interoperable spoken-audio metadata ingest system project that is the boundary object for this talk, emerged out of the goals of the SpokenWeb SSHRC Partnership Grant research network to digitize, process, describe, and aggregate the metadata of a diverse range of sound collections documenting literary and cultural activity in Canada since the 1950s. Our talk, collaboratively written and delivered by a literary scholar and critical theorist, a digital projects and systems development librarian, and a library developer / programmer, outlines 1) a theoretical rationale for the audiotext as a significant form of data in the humanities, 2) consequent modes of description deemed necessary to render such data useful for humanities scholars, and 3) a rationale for the development of a specific form of database system given the material and systems contexts that inform our national holdings of documentary literary sound recordings at the present time.[Figure 1. Screenshot of Swallow Dashboard]  Rationale of digitized audiotexts as humanities research data Why is the study of literary recordings important? With the introduction of viable sound recording technology in the last decade of the nineteenth century, a new form of material data for literary analysis emerged: the audiotext. This new literary artifact, based on the sound signal of the poet’s acoustic performance, has been defined as “a semantically denser field of linguistic activity” that demands new methods of analysis (Bernstein). Once digitized, engagement with sound recordings move us further down the path of understanding “The Text” as “a methodological field” (Barthes), and towards increasingly elaborate “rationales of audio text” (Clement) realized in relation to information systems for the purposes of software analysis, content modeling, and cataloguing. The digitized archive of voices invites the production of thorough metadata, and thus expands the ways in which we may remodel our understanding of historical cultural artifacts. Over the past two decades, due in part to the founding of online repositories of literary recordings like PennSound (PennSound center for programs in contemporary writing at the University of Pennsylvania 2020) and SpokenWeb (SpokenWeb 2020) the potential of the literary sound archive for research has become discernible. The implications of such research are momentous for future methodologies in the humanities, and yet the realization of such research is limited, at present, by the status and structure of our collections of literary sound recordings. In Canada, thousands of hours of literary readings, performance and related activities have been recorded on magnetic tape since the 1950s. The affordances of tape recording and subsequent media technologies enabled new literary uses of sound recording, including the documentation of literary events, readings and conversations, both public and private. This extended the reach of capturing literary forms and events, and consequently, transformed our understanding of what comprised the literary and cultural events. As valuable archival materials, these recordings represent a massive, largely untapped, undifferentiated, and often undiscovered resource for the study of literary art, culture and society. Research in literary sound studies depends upon a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to the development of historical knowledge about these valuable cultural heritage materials, and of a networked structure of digital repositories and research-focused interfaces for the preservation and meaningful presentation of these materials to researchers, students, artists and the public. Swallow, the metadata system we launched in 2019 and intend to augment into a robust tool for sharing metadata about our national audio holdings across multiple institutions and a diverse range of metadata and access systems, is a coded software system that represents and works to realize the theoretical idea of audiotexts as significant digital humanities data.A Poetics of Audio Description, or, a Metadata Schema for Literary AudioThe diversity of recordings held at SpokenWeb partner institutions across Canada include recorded conversations, dictations, compilations, performances, interviews and lectures, among numerous other generic audiotextual categories. How do we begin to describe the features and contents of such recordings, and in what ways may we make collections of documentary sound recordings speak to each other, beyond their local venues of origin and siloed media formats and archives?Metadata and its structure has the potential to open and limit avenues of research. The aggregation of metadata from partner institutions requires either choosing an existing access system, such as Islandora (Islandora Open source digital asset management 2020) or Avalon (Avalon Media System 2020), with its own metadata schema, or to design one based on the evolving research needs of the project. We have chosen the latter because we do not wish to limit our research questions to any single digital repository platform. During the extensive metadata collection phase of our research program, we are seeking maximum usability. We are pursuing our work in describing the assets and contents of collections of documentary literary sound recordings using an agile, iterative development process. We have developed our long-form metadata schema over the course of a year through the research, discussion, and regular meetings of a SpokenWeb Metadata Task Force consisting of librarians, literary researchers and students from across our partnership. We have provided the metadata schema (Camlot et al. 2020) and ingest software out to student cataloguers quickly for testing and feedback, so that the schema has been shaped by research use from the outset, and will continue to be shaped by researcher feedback throughout this seven-year cataloguing project. We based the SpokenWeb schema on standards such as IASA (International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives 1999), AACR2 (Joint Steering Committee for Revision of AACR 2005) and MODS (Library of Congress 2018), focusing on the most useful simplified instructions for the audiotext metadata context.The initial result was a SpokenWeb Metadata Schema with standard core fields such as: Title, Rights, Creators/Contributors, Production Context, enre, and Contents. The material artifact description recommendations in the schema include detailed sub-fields reflecting research interest, such as: AV Type, Material Designation, Physical Composition, Storage Capacity, Extent, Playing Speed, Track Configuration, Playback Mode, Tape Brand. The digital file description was a multiple field from the beginning, allowing for multiple files per material artifact. We later added Contents and Notes sub-fields that are capable of storing XML markup to Digital File Description, to make it possible to associate content annotations for each of the files in case of multi-file items. Following feedback from cataloguers who encountered event recording spanning multiple artifacts, it made sense to make Material Description into a multiple field as well. Other examples of changes include: the addition of “Performance Date” to Date Types and “Classroom recording” to Production Context.We recognized the research need to catalogue event/venue names and locations early on, and included location subfields for venue names, latitude and longitude, links to OpenStreetMap nodes, and notes for additional context.For qualifying and describing authorship, we predefined a controlled vocabulary by selecting from the Library of Congress relators those roles relevant to audiotext, such as interviewer, author, presenter. In the second iteration of the schema, we made it possible to associate multiple roles for a contributor, and following feedback from one of our partner institutions working with First Nations content, we added the role of “Elder”. In addition, soon after the launch of Swallow, the First Nations Metis and Inuit Indigenous Ontology was released, and we added the Nation subfield and controlled vocabulary lookup based on this for Creators/Contributors. The Contents field has been designed to facilitate navigation, searching and linking audio content of one recording to a wide collection of others. The inclusion of a Related Works field is one way to facilitate linking. The content information needs to be able to include time stamped structural and descriptive information about the works and creators on the recordings. There are many possible tools and formats to perform this type of time stamped metadata. Swallow allows for the storage of contents field information using text or XML markup. We also developed recommendations for how to annotate literary audio for the project and a Python/Flask script to convert text formatted annotations to Avalon XML (Neugebauer 2020). Avalon’s XML format for audio annotations was extended slightly to make it possible to package multiple digital files’ annotations into a single Avalon XML file.  Swallow and the rationale for an iterative database design The SpokenWeb collections are diverse and dispersed in archives and different repository systems. The networked approach we have pursued has allowed the research network to proceed with aggregating the metadata from partners without having to limit the infrastructure by choosing only one repository system with its associated metadata schema. However, we have also needed to move beyond spreadsheets, to improve the accuracy and usability of the cataloguing work. A spreadsheet of metadata quickly becomes difficult to manage as the number of columns increases to accommodate multiple fields, to catalogue multiple creators/contributors, for example. In addition, the research requirements of the project call for a highly customizable and extendible set of metadata fields that will change over time as we analyze and catalogue the content and learn more about the collections. We needed to be able to rapidly iterate new versions of interfaces for evolving metadata schema. Our solution has been to avoid hardcoding the metadata schema into the relational database, and instead to store the metadata as unstructured JSON inside the database. A layer of abstraction then allows us to quickly modify configuration files that define the metadata fields and their associated controlled vocabularies and lookups. The resulting system’s cataloguing interface may then be changed quickly, and is able to accommodate multiple schemas. Indeed, we have implemented numerous additions and changes to the metadata system over the course of our first year of cataloguing in response to the nature of specific collections we are describing.Swallow makes it possible for literary audio holding institutions to aggregate their metadata in a single system. The required metadata fields for access and preservation can change over time and vary by document type and source institution. Swallow allows for the aggregation of metadata in multiple metadata schemas in the same system. It generates a schema-specific cataloguing interface for each item stored, based on the item’s respective schema configuration files that include a list of steps, metadata fields and controlled vocabularies. The Swallow schema specification functionality currently allows for the inclusion of URIs alongside metadata values that are a part of the SpokenWeb Schema, such as links to VIAF, OpenStreetMap, Wikidata, and Rights Statements.  Future developmentFigure 2 shows the proposed flow of information with Swallow at the center acting as a central metadata repository. The functionality that we are proposing to develop includes the capacity to batch ingest metadata from other systems currently used by SpokenWeb partners into the latest version of the SpokenWeb schema in Swallow. The functionality to access batch import mappings on the interface exists, and we will develop the mappings for Islandora, Avalon, and AtoM in collaboration with partner institutions, Concordia Spectrum Research Repository, SFU Radar, University of Alberta Dataverse, University of Toronto (Dataverse), UBC Brain Circuits (FRDR). The proposed functionality includes the development of batch editing that would allow cataloguers to modify the metadata of collections of items. We will also develop mapping specifications that will allow for the migration of items catalogued in one schema version into another. The proposed development would build into the interface the functionality to lookup and export metadata from Swallow to Wikidata. In addition, we will develop mappings for export of collections of metadata as data from Swallow to DataVerse and FRDR (Canadian Association of Research Libraries & Compute Canada 2020) . [Figure 2. Swallow as central metadata repository] Conclusion Our work in metadata and systems development can be read as the development as a poetics of the audiotext, that is a poesis (a making) of the descriptive and digital infrastructure that allows digitized audio artifacts – artifacts that capture the sound of literature in its social contexts during the postwar era – to survive and take flight in the imaginations of contemporary critics, scholars, poets and listeners.","jason.camlot@concordia.ca, Tomasz.Neugebauer@concordia.ca, francisco.berrizbeitia@concordia.ca",Long Presentation

For many years, efforts have been made to translate the TEI Guidelines and specifications into languages other than the original English. These efforts, however, have often been frustrated or eventually abandoned. Despite the TEI's ingenious infrastructural support for translation, for which much credit is due to the late Sebastian Rahtz, it is difficult for translation efforts to stay continuously up to date with the Guidelines, which change incrementally and employ terminology that is often technical and sometimes unclear. In a recent meeting as part of the Triangle Scholarly Communications Institute, a group of scholars focused on the problem of communicating the TEI and developed proposals to remedy the problems with translating the TEI documentation. The conclusions and next steps that were identified in that meeting are the focus of this poster.It is quite clear that the flow of knowledge as we try to communicate the TEI cannot simply go from English to other languages: the act of translating can highlight cases where the Guidelines and specifications are insufficiently clear or even wrong. Revisions to the original document may be required. Research groups working with different languages may discover they have problems and solutions in common. Therefore, it is important that the TEI Consortium should take active responsibility for coordinating ongoing translation efforts, foregrounding them, and ensuring that they have the tools and affordances they need for their work. Additionally, the advent of reasonably useful machine translation may prove to be an important catalyst (though not by itself sufficient) for translation efforts. A glossary of TEI technical terms must be developed, accompanied by notes and examples for translators, so that it is clear not just what a term means, but why it (or its translation) was chosen, and how it is to be used.Further, the affordances on the TEI's website must be improved so that it is clear to beginners where to start and where useful examples may be found. As part of this, and of the translation of the specifications, it may be necessary to move the Guidelines themselves out of the foreground and to make the more easily internationalized specifications the primary point of contact for users. Although it is probably inevitable that a single language (which must probably be English for historical reasons) be used as a common basis of discourse for the TEI, a concerted effort must be made to provide introductory materials in other languages. This poster will document the steps we are taking towards ensuring that communication between the different linguistic communities using TEI can flow in multiple directions. We intend to make the ways TEI is communicated more equitable so that it may be adopted by a more diverse user base.","philomousos@gmail.com, martina.scholger@uni-graz.at, helena.bermudezsabel@unil.ch, ldmm@uvic.ca, gdelrio.riande@gmail.com, nagasaki@dhii.jp",Poster

Authors can tweet back to their readers, like William Gibson tweeted to an MLA panel in January of 2015 on his novel The Peripheral, to engage in immediate and mediated conversations about their work on a global scale. In this short paper I ask “What is a Reader?” because the Amazon-owned social media site, Goodreads, changes how readers respond to literature. While literary culture was once accessible primarily to those who had the means to acquire formal education, now literature is widely accessible and frequently free online; this shift in access is tied to an evolving version of literary knowledge in the digital age. There are free, online lectures about literature through TED Talks and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and discussion forums on the Internet are widely available through Goodreads, LibraryThing, Amazon, and Facebook’s Year of Books. While “lowbrow” or popular literature is not easily separated from “highbrow” literature in any historical period, the difference between the two has never been so muddied as in the twenty-first century. In this paper, I explore how the medium of Goodreads influences how readers respond to works by close and distant reading the comment section for two well-reviewed books on the site, Louise Erdrich’s The Round House, a novel about the rape of a Native American woman by a non-Native man and Stephanie Myer’s Twilight, a series about vampire romance. I situate the comments section for these two books within the broader context of comments posted on Goodreads about literature in order to highlight how online delivery systems can impact how and what we read. Because online delivery systems, like Goodreads, have the power to promote certain works over others, what constitutes literary value continues to change and therein their appeal to audiences beyond academic institutions. As a consequence, the taste of the large online public begins to define the classificatory matrix foundational to canon design; in turn, these seemingly “objective” classifications forged through algorithmic machine intelligence begin to fossilize a new canon. And yet, in circulating some texts selectively over others, these systems of counting and accounting define what counts as literature.",ashley_champagne@brown.edu,Lightning

The algorithm depends on Google’s meticulous recording and machine-reading of the personal data of an untold number of its 1.5 billion Gmail users, leveraging users’ words and writing for the development of the technology. In this context, language is particularly vulnerable to corporate intervention and manipulation. As such, this presentation carefully considers Fréderic Kaplan’s call to action: “through… the advent of algorithms as a new media, something is likely happen [sic] to language, and, although we are not yet sure what it will be, new tools must be built in order to understand this global linguistic evolution”.Responding to Kaplan's call, I report on experiments with Smart Compose in which I am manually transcribing more than 50,000 words from published texts and, subsequently, annotating and visualizing input to and output from the algorithm. These experiments are part of my larger doctoral project that seeks to locate the shifting ""semantic coordinates"" (Striphas, 2015, p. 398) of ""language,"" ""words,"" and ""writing"" in an algorithmic culture. Applying the framework of data colonialism, I argue that word-prediction algorithms such as Smart Compose must necessarily shift our understanding of these terms when words become data and writing becomes a datafied practice.More broadly, I suggest that in place of the question posed by Siva Vaidhyanathan some years ago—“what do we gain and what do we lose by inviting Google to be the lens through which we see the world?”—we must, urgently and necessarily, ask this: what do we gain and what do we lose by allowing Google to offer the words through which we write the world?",crystal.chokshi1@ucalgary.ca,Short Presentation

We can even speak of a distant reading school, nowadays. The diffusion of distant reading approaches has raised a lively debate (mostly in the North American context), and has attracted various criticisms, both from “traditional literary scholars” and self-critical adopters that can be subsumed into a threefold typology: Theoretical/Ideological: the intentional and qualitative nature of the literary domain is in principle irreducible to quantitative and computational methods; literature is not data and literary criticism is not data analytics;Methodological: the (statistical/computational) models and methods adopted for literary analysis are wrong, inaccurate, and ultimately inadequate; Pragmatical: the limits in the representativeness of the textual data set used in the analysis and the problems in defining the adequacy of its selection criteria.Each of these kinds of criticisms would need a deep discussion and are strictly interconnected. For instance, in the well-known Da’s articles, allegedly oriented presented as a replication failure study, the following excerpts makes apparent that the author has an a priori skepticism about the epistemological possibility of what she calls “computational literary studies:There is a fundamental mismatch between the statistical tools that are used and the objects to which they are applied. It may be the case that computational textual analysis has a threshold of optimal utility, and literature—in particular, reading literature well—is that cut-off point. I think that one of the main reasons underlying these more or less critical positions toward distant reading is the fact that it lacks sound and coherent rationales from the point of view of the theory: in fact, we can say that distant reading is the first methodology in literary studies that does not come with a theory of literature embedded in it, as it was for all of its predecessors. Consequently, all distant reading studies derive their theoretical frameworks and terms from theories in the literary domain that generally relies on the fundamental idea that literary texts can be explained only by the way of interpretation or if we prefer of hermeneutics.The problem is that any literary interpretation based on quantitative, immanent, and purely formalist approach is subject to the theoretical criticism that was expressed by Stanley Fish in his harsh and seemingly ultimate criticism to stylistics in “What Is Stylistics, and Why Are They Saying Such Terrible Things About It?” (Fish, 1980). The point for Fish was not to criticize the methods per se, but the possibility to extract meaningful literary interpretations directly from the simple linguistic facts, the idea of an “algorithmic interpretation” (Fish’s words!), since interpretation always starts from a contextual and situated point of view that pre-defines the very objects of its actuation.Many important scholars active in the field do believe that there is the possibility to reconcile traditional theories (of literature) with computational/quantitative methods. Just to make a couple of examples of these consilience theses, we can cite Andrew Piper (Piper, 2018) and Michael Gavin (Gavin, 2018). Piper proposes a sort of computational hermeneutics, that integrates distant and close, and quantitative and qualitative readings. Michael Gavin argues that “vector semantics share a set of assumptions with literary critic William Empson, who devoted his career to explaining how poets played with words’ many meanings”. What is suspicious in these (and similar but often less intriguing and thought-provoking) calls to the reconciliation of the two poles is that their outcomes are either literary critically unsatisfactory or are self-contradictory, in that the hermeneutical and critical part of the discourse is self-standing, the critical arguments are logically independent from the results of the computational analysis.On the base of these considerations, I think that distant reading simply cannot be considered a methodological innovation to be applied to our pre-existing theories of literary texts (in all their rhizomatic variants): it is necessary to find a suitable theory or framework where these methods can yield to interesting results. To make a substantial step in this direction we should first of all take seriously the notion of distant reading and abandon the idea of literature as either made of singular special individuals (the great or the small texts, amenable to interpretations by literary critics, or the big or small writers) or reduced to abstract ideal type, under the scrutiny of literary theoreticians with no clue with empirical evidence. This move would import also taking seriously the move from (or renounce to) interpretation to (embrace) explanation as the real aim of the scholarly inquiry.On what theoretical basis, then, can we construct a notion of literature amenable to distant reading methods?One possible direction to be explored as some scholars like Ted Underwood suggests, is that distant reading should fall inside the tradition of sociology of literature or history of ideas a la Nouvelle Histoire. Although there are many reasons to lean toward a sociological vision of literature as an optimal base for distant reading, I think that an even better theoretical framework is that of the cognitive and bio-evolutionistic approaches to literature and the cultural evolution studies. Cognitive poetics/narratology, and bio/evolutionary literary studies have been two of the most interesting waves of innovation in the literary field of the last 30 years and are now established field of inquiry. With different graduation depending on the authors, they have advocated the introduction of a more scientific methodology in the study of literature, looking for methodological and theoretical insights into cognitive science and evolutionary psychology.What is more interesting for my thesis is that, not surprisingly, the debate around the legitimacy and acceptability of the cognitive approaches in literary studies has determined a discussion on the problem of literary interpretation that has many similarities with the discourse I have proposed in this paper. Recently, a young and brilliant scholar active in the field, Marco Caracciolo, has re-opened the debate, and in doing this he has explicitly stated that “In order to contribute to cognitive science, literary scholarship has to complement—and in some cases even supplant—interpretation with a different set of goals and methods”.The other scientific field where literary studies can find a theoretical framework that takes great advantage of distant reading methodology is that of cultural evolution. This field of study that as of now has no application in literary studies, aims at providing a naturalist and empirical explanation of the nature and evolution of culture, adopting widely mathematical/statistical and computational modeling.One of the theoretical underpinnings of cultural evolution is the adoption of the population thinking framework, taken from evolutionary biology (after Ernest Mayr interpretation of Darwin’s theory) and population genetics, and its application to cultural phenomena as pointed out recently by Dan Sperber and his collaborators: Literature is part of the cultural sphere, so it can be considered a population of individual items (the texts) whose members are defined by a set of measurable features. The description of the population at a given state (synchronic, in our beloved Sausurrian terms) and its evolution (diachronic) is feasible by the way of statistical and data-driven analysis.To conclude, I think that in order to take full advantage of the most advanced methods and analytical techniques encompassed by the label Distant reading, like text mining and machine learning, in literary and cultural studies, we need to find a proper theoretical framework that gives sense to the hypothesis experiments, data sets and explanations we can generate. The attempt to justify and anchor this approach in the context of the traditional literary theories and methodologies has proven a limitation that undermines the interesting analytical results, and it is easily amenable to the ‘so what’ criticism, or ideological attacks. Maybe it is time to change the framework, and to abandon the classical hermeneutical literary studies environment.",fabio.ciotti@uniroma2.it,Short Presentation

It argues that the production of models is the core contribution of RSE to the epistemology of DH. We adopt an inclusive definition of models and modelling which spans the whole range from ‘deformative’ to empirical modelling (see Smithies 2017: 168), including formal or predictive modelling, and the technical solutions produced in the process as well as the know-how, languages and documentation which accompany this production. From this wide perspective, models are also artefacts which can be studied across the history of science and of the humanities tradition and in comparison with other modelling practices in science. RSE practice is grounded on a strong conscience of the experimental apparatus and the iterative critique of models built (and often deflated) for a purpose. The challenge is to recognise the idiosyncrasy and situatedness of modelling practices and artefacts while devising methods to expose the scalability of the underlying workflows and modelling processes.We reflect on the epistemology of DH from the practical perspective of our RSE lab - King’s Digital Lab (KDL)2 - and the research processes embedded in our Software Development Lifecycle (fig.1). The human element is at the core of the technical ecosystem we research and operate in. We acknowledge that KDL models and modelling are co-constitutive of human expertise, technical systems and operational methods, all aspiring to an environment conducive of open knowledge. This is not only in terms of development and management approaches via adoption of open standards, open source and exposure of open data but also, more fundamentally, in sharing (achievements and struggles around) our processes and in promoting open models. We will use project-specific examples, including data modelling and knowledge representation practices, to demonstrate how some of our research into model-making processes challenge the perception of the technical work of RSE within DH as a stale, mechanistic and uncritical procedural activity.Figure 1 KDL Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) mapped to Agile DSDM project phases (Agile Business Consortium 2014).KDL operates within a rather unique context. It claims its origins in the pioneering work of colleagues at King’s College London working in applied computing in the Humanities already in the 1970s (see Short et al. 2012). However, the crossings between RSE and DH communities at King’s and internationally are only recently being highlighted and explored. We argue that the study and building of models is one of the dimensions via which these crossings emerge more vividly with substantial epistemological implications and innovative ramifications for the field of DH as a whole.The core practice of research in DH is modelling, which implies the translation of complex systems of knowledge or conceptual frameworks into computationally processable models or operational frameworks.Gooding (2003) claims that in experimental settings computational approaches are analogues to other processes of abstraction, measurement and contextual interpretation, whereby reduction of complexity is followed by expansion in the guise of a double funnel-shaped process. We can trace these processes of reduction and expansion also in the RSE context, where, for example, operationalisation makes models formalised into snippets of code or software components. Other languages than translation into code play a role in the process, however.3The paper will reflect on models as artefacts of different kind expressed via a variety of languages, including but not limited to computational models, produced during several phases of the SDLC (see Ciula and Smithies, forthcoming) such as:negotiations around the meaning of the project units of analysis documented in diagrams and definitions which shape requirements and an agreed project language;paper or whiteboard sketches used to draft the solution architecture for a project in its feasibility assessment;wireframes and static mockups of user journeys;data models implementing the logical structure of a database;statistical models implemented with ad hoc algorithms and code or relying on tested formulas and existing libraries.While specific instantiations of models (for example in relational databases) can have a rather short life, in the RSE context and projects where they were designed and developed, they often represented innovative solutions which have a longstanding effect. Indeed, while models are temporary pragmatic solutions to address specific project challenges yet, at the scale KDL operates, they are the backbone of the team's tacit knowledge as well as the building blocks towards more generalisable and re-usable approaches. They mediate and bridge the layers of the Lab’s socio-technical system: team expertise, data and technical systems.Figure 2 Multilayered socio-technical system of the Lab where concentric circles denote co-constitution of team expertise, data and technical systems.While we can refine existing approaches to sustain and expose modelling efforts in SDLC cycles which rely on RSE best practices such as attention to documentation and re-use,4 there is also room for more innovative approaches, including a design first culture, workflow integration across RSE roles, the assessment and potential adoption of a set of modelling notation languages for the exposure mechanisms for our models.In alignment with a “critical modelling” approach (see Bode 2020), but also with a material culture and media literacy perspective, in this paper we aim to reflect upon models by looking at the wide epistemological implications of their production and use, at the responsibilities of modellers, at how models come to be and what effect they have in the resources they contribute to instantiate and hence in interpretative processes of expansion as well as reduction. A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the symposium Computational Text Analysis and Historical Change, held at Humlab, Umeå University (Sweden), 4-6 September 2019. The authors currently cover different roles at King’s Digital Lab (KDL), a Research Software Engineering (RSE) team hosted by the Faculty of Arts & Humanities at King’s College London, which provides software development and infrastructure to departments in the Faculty of Arts & Humanities while also collaborating with Social Science & Public Policy as well as a range of external partners in the higher education and cultural heritage sectors. Data modelling, for example, is informed if not driven by communication and collaborative reasoning around more or less standardised graphical representations and notations in phases of reverse engineering as well as design methods. Note that KDL intend and use design methods in a wide sense ranging from techniques of requirements elicitation in pre-project analysis to data modelling and wireframing in evolutionary development (see Bennet et al. 2005). Equally, the re-integration or expansion of modelling efforts into interpretative frameworks usually rely on verbal and visual language to document code, or to explain the results of an experiment (Ciula and Marras 2019: 39). With this respect see, for example, the KDL checklist for assessment of digital outputs within the UK Research Framework Exercise. Models contribute to define and redefine objects of study which come charged with layers of scholarship and analysis, with previous selections, bias and political as well as ethical responsibilities.

In line with ongoing discussions around the representativeness and constraints of the digital archive presented some lucid analysis around modellers’ responsibilities in digital literary studies by exposing the gaps that propagate from produced literary works we know of to material preserved in the analogue archive, to selections of works that make it into digital archives to further reductions in the creation of a corpus of analysis and, last but not least, in the application of statistical modelling techniques which dictate additional powerful yet limiting constraints if not contextualised critically within an interlocked chain of bias.","arianna.ciula@kcl.ac.uk, paul.caton@kcl.ac.uk, ginestra.ferraro@kcl.ac.uk, brian.maher@kcl.ac.uk, geoffroy.noel@kcl.ac.uk, jose.m.vieira@kcl.ac.uk",Long Presentation

The project draws upon hundreds of finding aids and additional biographic data, charting connections between these figures ranging from their correspondence to the works dedicated to and translated by one another. The project is intended to act as a public humanities resource for understanding the forces underpinning queer diaspora while encouraging scholars to rethink our conceptions of artistic influence beyond the misogynistic, heteronormative notions presented 35 years ago in Harold Bloom's The Anxiety of Infuence.In addition to drawing upon scholarly work on archipelagos (Manolo Guzman, Michelle Stephens, Island Studies Journal), this project draws upon Digital Humanities projects visualizing and recuperating historical networks such as Republic of Letters and Mapping Marronage as well as conversations about recovering and amplifying history via Digital Humanities projects.Ultimately, Archivepelago’s main features will be 1) interactive network maps demonstrating relationships in terms of correspondence, translations of one another’s works, and shared demographic or psychographic characteristics such as religious affiliations; 2) interactive geographic maps depicting the migration of individual writers and artists, demonstrating emerging communities in metropolitan centers such as Paris, NYC, Algiers, and Mexico City; and 3) an online exhibit outlining key concepts drawing on well-known moments and figures (e.g., Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein) and lesser-known figures like Charles Warren Stoddard.In our current phase of the project, we are isolating translations of queer writers translating one another’s work cataloged in finding aids and adding this information to our Neo4j graph database. We will share our findings by visualizing what Arjun Appadarai describes as “cultural flows” across languages (e.g., Langston Hughes’ translations of Gabriela Mistral and Federico Garcia Lorca) and periods (e.g., John Addington Symonds’ translations of Sappho and other Classical as well as Renaissance poetry) while putting our data in conversation with contemporary work on queer translations. Over the course of this presentation, we will illustrate the types of queries made possible by our graph database while discussing the significant figures and trends within these networks.",corey.clawson@rutgers.edu,Short Presentation

The primary source is the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). IMDb is one of the most robust databases available and provides free downloadable data about the actors and crew that worked on various media items, including TV, movies, and video games. However, it is problematic in a number of ways, as we presented at DH2018. IMDb appears to be under-researched as a source for media studies in DH, with many scholars focusing on fan activity, or on film actors and directors only, with most not questioning IMDb genres. This presentation will explore the contrast between IMDb’s methods and the schema we have had to create. It also discusses some of the challenges we faced, and how we think this could aid other researchers creating public digital humanities databases.Steve Neale writes in Genre and Contemporary Hollywood, “genres can be approached from the point of view of the industry and its infrastructure, from the point of view of their aesthetic traditions, from the point of view of the broader socio-cultural environment upon which they draw and into which they feed, and from the point of view of audience understanding and response.” We must consider all of these concepts as our work encompasses not only Hollywood film, the subject of most genre analysis, but media of every type including much that is obscure or forgotten. IMDb’s genre methodology was inadequate, so we turned to industry-focused websites to enhance our understanding.Other schemas use very vague macro descriptors, or idiosyncratic descriptors allowing a media item to be included in multiple “lists.” A movie in the Library of Congress is simply Comedy, Drama, Action, etc. AFI divides films into “best” but also “most thrilling” (including action, horror, and adventure). The Telegraph writes that Netflix’s “genres, based on a complicated algorithm that uses reams of data about users' viewing habits . . . number in the tens of thousands” including commonly-accepted genres like “Action” but also “Family Watch Together TV.” We attempted to taxonomize, expanding and limiting the optionsavailable to encompass the full range of programming, but not get so esoteric that they cannot be clustered together and measured. We have created a vocabulary/schema to allow for clear communication as part of Public Humanities. We cannot, for example, talk about the representation of women in a particular subgenre if we do not have a shared understanding of it. If other scholars also use this schema (or work with us to adapt it), each media item can be described in a way that allows for effective and relatively consistent coding by multiple scholars.Genre on IMDb is handled in ways that are not useful for analysis because terms are used in inconsistent ways. There’s not enough inter-rater reliability, the tags are misleading, and scholars do not all agree on how to use them. As Deb Verhoeven states in “Mapping the Movies,” a project like her team’s “only works if the existing data collection is both sufficiently comprehensive and thoroughly reliable, since it will have to be accepted by all partners” (Verhoeven). There is little consistent agreement on genre among scholars or fans, as borne out in genre theory. What IMDb designates as “genres” actually combines traditional genres, subgenres, and target audience categories. As IMDb allows those who enter the data to select any number of these terms, and many fans enjoy labeling media items to fit multiple lists, it becomes impossible to analyze using IMDb’s categories. In large part this is because the database relies heavily on users: sometimes cast/crew members, agents, producers, and fans, for its data and for much editing. As Wasserman et al., point out, “Although user editing allows a reference website such as IMDb to be up-to-date, it diffuses the responsibility for fact-checking, leading to greater uncertainty about accuracy and objectivity of information” (Wasserman).It has taken significant additional research and reorganization to use the data effectively because, as media researchers Marsden, et al. explain, there is not enough agreement about metadata. While most people can tell a Western from Science Fiction, IMDb makes it more difficult to deal with hybrid genres such as Dramedies or Family movies, or where a particular movie or show combines genres, such superimposing Western generic concepts into Science Fiction, or an Action/Adventure movie with a strong romantic plot. The schemas used by the Library of Congress, Netflix, Amazon and others are too reductive or imprecise for our purposes.Therefore, we not only had to create a taxonomy with a variety of categories, including subjects, styles, modes, and purposes, but our own concise definitions for these categories. We will share parts of our schema in this presentation.","cindy.conaway@esc.edu, diane.shichtman@esc.edu",Lightning

Analytics have most often been used for textual analysis in literary studies (Piper 2018). What should “distant reading” look like in prosopographical literary history? In this talk, I will examine various metrics that can be used to analyze and classify writers, as well as the potential significance of each metric. Using the concept of “sets,” I classify writers as “globally successful,” “nationally successful,” “prolific,” “minor,” or “one-hit wonders,” based on information on these writers’ literary production derived from viaf.org data and combined with demographic data. The core dataset for this project is a database I have built of 10,000 French writers active at some time from 1700 to 1914 and a smaller subset of the top 1000 writers. This project uses the schema “Procope,” developed as a part of the Mapping the Republic of Letters project at Stanford University (Comsa et al. 2016), combined with data from the National Library of France, to produce a large dataset of writers ranging from published authors of major works to correspondents of note, minor writers, and what I call “one-hit wonders,” authors who have only one hit in library catalogues and are more likely to be unpublished authors or writers of correspondence than what we think of as canonical authors. The dataset also includes women writers from the Huygens database of women writers to address the lack of women writers in the other datasets. I use the following metrics from VIAF: the number of items held in libraries, number of current ISBNs, and the number of countries where materials are held.In this new project, I consider various metrics which could be used to rank these writers, as well as similar projects by Ted Underwood and Mikko Tolonen with his group in Helsinki. I explore ways that writers could be grouped into sets and how these sets can be used to write alternative histories of literary and social movements by focusing on minor writers and figures who are generally marginal to histories of literary movements. The social and demographic data can be compared to “productivity” metrics from library catalogues, such as number of works published and number of editions, to make observations about which social networks (that is, academies, salons, movements) were more likely to produce successful or unsuccessful writers - both in the short term (in terms of contemporaneous publication) and in the long term (in terms of archiving and post-mortem publications). Finally, I look at which genres “failed” at a greater rate and the social status of “successful” and “failed” writers. Through this analysis, I produce a more nuanced picture of literary success than the division of writers into “canonical” and “non-canonical,” especially by looking at writers who do not generally make it into literary histories at all.",mrconroy@memphis.edu,Short Presentation

It takes RavenSpace as its case study, a new publishing platform for media-rich, networked, interactive books in Indigenous studies where communities and scholars can work together to share and create knowledge. Developed by UBC Press along with the University of Washington Press and other partners, and funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the platform respects Indigenous protocols for accessing and using cultural heritage and traditional knowledge while meeting the standards of peer-reviewed academic publishing. It enables authors to present their own work and to recontextualize materials already online in accord with Indigenous protocols for attribution, control, care, and sharing. It offers multiple paths through projects to reach different audiences.Indigenous communities and scholars increasingly shape their research to serve the needs and priorities of the communities involved, including their cultural preservation and revitalization efforts, educational initiatives, and capacity building goals, among others. As the Māori scholar and educator Linda Tuhiwai Smith writes, “Indigenous research seeks to ... find the new/old solutions that restore Indigenous being in the world. The impacts are part of an intergenerational long game of decolonization, societal transformation, healing and reconciliation, and the recovery of a world where all is well.”[1] Of relevance to the public digital humanities and open data movements that some participate in, Indigenous scholars and community experts want to present their research in innovative ways that engage and are tailored to the various scholarly, community, and public audiences they aim to reach. In light of the historical misappropriation of Indigenous cultural heritage, they are also concerned with developing protocols for accessing and protecting that heritage in the digital domain. There is an ongoing tension between Indigenous concerns and the open data movement within public digital humanities, since digital “repatriation” has often resulted in Indigenous materials being dumped online, decontextualized and open to the world. Traditional publishing models also fail to meet new needs. Neither the old authorial hierarchies nor the limitations of the printed book do justice to the research currently being carried out by Indigenous communities and scholars. How can publishers develop new modes of publishing that respond to contemporary scholarship and learning in Indigenous studies, are accountable to the Indigenous peoples involved in the projects, and respect Indigenous protocols for the control, use, and sharing of their cultural knowledge and materials? This poster focuses on the technical and social infrastructure developed for this purpose in RavenSpace. It demonstrates the tools and methods designed to address these questions in a digital space, including adaptable approaches to establishing protocols for the respectful use of cultural content and processes that support collaborative authorship. It explains how the academic publishers involved in RavenSpace have expanded the peer review process to include both academic and community review. It also point people to the first RavenSpace publication, As I Remember It, by Sliammon Elder Elsie Paul with Davis McKenzie, Paige Raibmon, and Harmony Johnson, published in 2019.","cullen@ubcpress.ca, bfuget@uw.edu, ridington@ubcpress.ca",Poster

The study of the poetic features of text, especially their rhythmic structure when forming verses, pertains to the different traditions, whose scholars established the rules that might govern poetry. Within this context, the POSTDATA Project formalized a network of ontologies able to express any poetic expression and its analysis at the European level, enabling scholars all over Europe to interchange their data using Linked Open Data. However, varied research interests result in corpora that might not share the same facets of an analysis. To alleviate this concern and foster the completeness of the interchanged corpora, our team set out to build a software toolkit to assist in the analysis of poetry. This paper introduces PoetryLab, an extensible open source toolkit for syllabification, scansion (extraction of stress patterns), enjambment detection (syntactical units split in two lines), rhyme detection, and historical named entity recognition for Spanish poetry. Our toolkit achieves state of the art performance in the tasks for which reproducible alternatives exist.Design PrinciplesManuals for metrical analysis of Spanish poetry exist at least since the 18th Century, although the foundational work and subsequent refined guides for modern analysis would take another century to appear. Despite such a long and rich tradition, not many computational tools have been created to assist scholars in the annotation and analysis of Spanish poetry. With ever increasing corpora sizes and the popularization of distant reading techniques, the possibility of automating part of the analysis became very appealing. Although solutions exist, they are either incomplete (i.e., fixed-metre poetry, mostly hendecasyllables, not applicable to Spanish, or not open nor reproducible. These limitations guided the design of PoetryLab. At its core (see Figure 1), PoetryLab provides a compliant OpenAPI that connects independent packages together. Built on top of the natural language processing framework spaCy, two Python packages perform scansion and enjambment detection, namely, Rantanplan and JollyJumper.1 In Spanish, some words are stressed depending on their function in the sentence, hence the need for a proper part of speech (PoS) tagger. AnCora, the corpus spaCy is trained on for PoS tagging of Spanish texts, splits most affixes thus causing some failures in the tags it assigns. To circumvent this limitation and to ensure clitics were handled properly, we integrated Freeling’s affixes rules via a custom built pipeline for spaCy. The resulting package, spacy-affixes,2 splits words with affixes before assigning PoS, and can be plugged in to a regular spaCy pipeline loading one of the statistical models for Spanish. This pipeline is the foundation for Rantanplan and JollyJumper, which are rule-based algorithms inspired by Ríos Mestre, Caparrós and Navarro Tomás, and Quilis and Spang, respectively. Figure 1. General architecture of PoetryLab.Following the OpenAPI specification, we defined a REST API that unified the internal interface of the different packages and provided a common endpoint for analysis. For external packages developed in languages other than Python, PoetryLab provides a pluggable architecture that allows their integration. This is the case for our named entity recognition system, HisMeTag, developed in Java and connected to the PoetryLab API through an internal REST API. The only requirement for third-party integrations is to consume text and produce both JSON and RDF triples.The PoetryLab API was then used to provide with functionality a React-based web interface that non-technical scholars can use to interact with the packages in a graphical way (see Figure 2). The frontend also allows downloading the generated data. Figure 2. PoetryLab showing stressed syllables (blue), sinalefas (‿) and enjambments (↵).ResultsOne notably difficult aspect of benchmarking automated analysis of Spanish poetry is the lack of a gold standard reference corpus. For the evaluation of the syllabification algorithm in PoetryLab we build a 100k words corpus using a combination of online resources,4 which we named EDFU and are releasing under a Creative Commons license.5 For metrical analysis we used Navarro-Colorado’s corpus. For mixed-metre we are using our own copus obtained from Carjaval’s annotated anthology. Unfortunately, we have not found a public corpus for rhyme and stanza identification yet, and although an enjambment corpus seems to exist, it is not publicly available.Table 1 shows the ratio of success extracting the list of syllables of the words in EDFU, and the correct metrical analysis for the different corpora and tools. Notably, PoetryLab achieves state of the art performance for syllabification and per line metrical analysis.7 We were unable to reproduce Gervás’ approach and are reporting their own ratios.Syllabification (EDFU)PoetryLab (rantanplan): 99.98Navarro-Colorado: 98.74Agirrezabal: 98.06Metrical patterns (fixed-metre)PoetryLab (rantanplan): 96.22Navarro-Colorado:94.44Gervás:88.73Agirrezabal:90.84Metrical pattern (mixed-metre)PoetryLab (rantanplan): 65.02Navarro-Colorado:49.38. Although at an early stage, PoetryLab has proven useful in that it highlights some issues with the existing corpora and techniques developed to this day. First, there was no alternative system to analyze poetry composed of other than hendecasyllables, for which we are using a corpus of mixed-metre poetry based on Carvajal’s original annotations. Moreover, we are contributing with a new corpora to evaluate syllabification procedures, and enriching the ecosystem of Python tools for Spanish by providing a spaCy pipeline that deals with clitics. Finally, we make the data produced by the PoetryLab machine readable, interoperable, and ready to be ingested into a triple store compliant with the POSTDATA Project network of ontologies.Eventually, PoetryLab will be integrated into the larger POSTDATA Project public website, making working with European repositories of poetry a more pleasant task, and assisting whenever possible with the metrical and rhetorical side of the analysis.Founding SourceResearch for this paper has been achieved thanks to the Starting Grant research project Poetry Standardization and Linked Open Data: POSTDATA (ERC-2015-STG-679528) obtained by Elena González-Blanco.

In the following years, ADHO conference organizers have been more attentive to ensuring the visible presence of women, and have put measures in place (e.g. arranging childcare) to make it easier for women to attend. However, conference participation by women and gender minorities1 remains limited (Eichmann et al. 2016), and attention to the needs and concerns of this demographic at the conference level has little impact on their day-to-day experiences working in digital humanities.The DH-WoGeM (Women and Gender Minorities* in DH) group was formed in fall 2018 to provide a forum for women and gender minorities to talk openly about the challenges they face at work, and possible ways to work towards addressing these issues. At DH 2019, the DHWoGeM “embodied DH” poster (as presented by a skeleton in a dress) won the most innovative poster award, and following the conference, the group submitted an application to be recognized as an ADHO Special Interest Group (SIG). The group’s goal is to take an intersectional, culturally appropriate approach to making explicit the challenges that women and gender minorities face when working in digital humanities, and advocating for concrete, actionable measures to better support women and gender minorities in their local context, as well as at their participation in international collaboration.The work of DH-WoGeM has taken many forms, including synchronous virtual “conversations”, a workshop, and an edited volume. This poster will distill key takeaway points from the group’s work to date, along with pointers to resources that attendees can use to reflect on ways to foster a more inclusive work environment. We will also use the poster to solicit responses to the first international survey that the group has undertaken, on work/life balance and caring responsibilities (e.g. childcare, caring for ill relatives or friends, self-care). This survey, which will be open during summer 2020, will collect anonymous information about how these factors have impacted the work and career trajectories of people engaged in doing DH work at all levels, from students through retirees, and in as many countries as possible. The survey is unprecedented in its attempt to gather an on-the-ground view of the experience of doing DH across the globe, and the ways that different cultural contexts mitigate and/or exacerbate the difficulty of maintaining work/life balance when engaged in DH work.","fadelma@hotmail.com, qad@stanford.edu, igalina@unam.mx, ctgniady@iu.edu, r.hendery@westernsydney.edu.au, roued@hum.ku.dk, e.samoilova@filmuniversitaet.de, vshepard@saonet.ucla.edu, debver@ualberta.ca, c.l.h.warwick@durham.ac.uk, amandawb@stanford.edu",Poster

But while this intrinsic interdisciplinarity (see e.g. Klein 2015) can be regarded as one of the research field's chief assets, it quickly becomes a considerable hurdle in the classroom. As Ryan Cordell suggests, we tend to overestimate the technical skills of our ‘tech-savvy,’ ‘digital native’ students – and perhaps even the general affinity they have towards digital tools and methodologies (Cordell 2016, 465). Without a formalized technical or computational background, the skills our students  bring to the table rely heavily on their individual interests, experiences, and auto-didacticism. This situation culminates in a heterogenous classroom that makes it difficult to assess where the gaps in each of the students' knowledge lie, and how they can be bridged. As such, the teacher's first task becomes to decide which basic skills the students will need for their digital research. As a result, technical DH courses often focus on teaching students specific skills that can be used in specific contexts to achieve specific research results, such as: How to use TEI-XML to encode a text-bearing object; How to use python to query a corpus of digital texts; How to use R to perform a stylometric analysis; How to use GIS frameworks to map data layers onto geographical zones; etc.As Mahony and Pierazzo argued in 2012, however, more than teaching such purely technical skills there is ""a need for teaching methodological approaches"". Rather than teaching students to use new technologies, we need to teach them how those technologies work: how their methodological constraints affect our data; how they determine what we can and cannot do with our data; and how seemingly simple data processing steps imply ""interpretative decisions that change the nature of the data and how it can be validly interpreted"". Still the question remains: ""What are the right basic requirements"" for our students? (Scagliola et al. 2019) – Where do we start?In this paper, we propose a 'minimal digital pedagogy' that applyies the principles of Minimal Computing in the classroom. As a working group of ADHO's GO:DH Special Interest Group, Minimal Computing sets out to rethink DH work for areas in the world where factors such as high-end hardware, software, network capacity, power, etc. are not a given, by performing our computational research ""under some set of significant constraints."" It is precisely such constraints, we believe, that allow us to get to the fundamentals of the technologies we are using – and to give our students a critical understanding of the tools they are using by building and configuring them from the ground up.This is the setup we have adopted for the Antwerp Summer School in DH – an intensive one-week summer school that aims to teach students the basics of developing and hosting their own digital archives and editions. In the last two years, we have developed a tutorial for deploying a IIIF-compliant image server on a local network of Raspberry Pis (RPi). At the next iteration of the summer school, we want to take this setup one step further by teaching students how develop a full-fledged Digital Scholarly Edition based on those reproductions. Much to our continued surprise, experience tells us that all of this is possible on a RPi. These affordable light-weight minicomputers the size of a credit card were originally designed to teach digital novices (especially children) computing and digital making skills, but have recently been successfully used in higher education classrooms as well. In our specific setup, students used RPis to up a Local Area Network where they installed, configured, and controlled web-based tools to host, share, and reuse digital reproductions of manuscripts with each other. This collaborative act of building a private network offered them a practical way to learn more about and play with fundamental computing concepts. In particular, through a series of tutorial instructions, integrated exercises, and group discussions, they were exposed to issues in physical computational and networking infrastructures; to working with unfamiliar operating systems; to operating a computer without an interface (command line); to communicating with and controlling other computers (SSH); to a number of data formats and markup languages (HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, Pyramid TIFF, etc.); and – crucially – they learned to approach important technological standards and complex digital frameworks (such as IIIF) from a developer’s perspective rather than from a user’s.But alongside the advantages of learning-by-building (Clement 2012; Ramsay and Rockwell 2012) and its applicability to a range of DH technologies, adopting a minimal computing approach to DH pedagogy has other benefits as well. To start, the setup is cost efficient: it requires no proprietary software, and can be run quasi-independently of the host institution’s technical infrastructure. A such, the minimal set of hardware for this course requires a onetime investment of around $1,500 – or less than a single up-to-date desktop computer. What is more, if the host institution provides an internet connection without AP isolation and participants bring their own laptops, the entire hardware setup for a course with up to 30 participants may even fit into a standard-sized carry-on trolley. And for students without personal computers, minor adaptations to the tutorial could be considered to provide a similar learning experience. Finally, since our current setup only uses the internet to update and download free Linux packages (which might be provided via a local repository within the RPi network), it may even be possible to teach this course without an internet connection. As such, this portable and independent setup would allow us to teach DH in areas with limited access to digital infrastructures – a setup that we hope to try out at a collaborating university in the Philippines.","wout.dillen@uantwerpen.be, Joshua.Schaeuble@uantwerpen.be",Long Presentation

Often the male “voice of God” narration pronounces meaning that is inaccurate or disrespectful, but the visual narratives are for the most part quite remarkable. At this historical distance, many of these films have come to be understood by both Native community insiders and outside scholars as documentation of cultural practices and lifeways—and, indeed, languages—that are receding as practitioners and speakers pass on. This project seeks to rebalance the historical record through digital intervention, intentionally shifting emphasis from external perceptions of Native peoples to the voices, knowledge, and languages of the peoples represented in the films by participatory recording of new narrations for the films. Native narrators record new narrations for the films, actively decolonizing this collection and performing information redress through the merger of vintage visuals and new audio. We propose to report on work-in-progress and future plans.“Tribesourcing” obviously plays off the term “crowdsourcing,” but intentionally places historical materials with the exact peoples they represent so they may address the untold or suppressed story. Furthermore, Native narrators are compensated for their contributions, and identified: aspects that temper what might otherwise be perceived as another example of soliciting “free” and “invisible” labor from communities of color. Films in this project are streamed through the interface of our chosen content management system, Mukurtu, beside alternate narrations from within the culture in English and in Native languages. This method allows for an unmediated approach to identification of people, places, practices, vocabulary and stories that might otherwise be lost, as well as providing a rich, community-based metadata record for each film. Taking a small step toward cultural repatriation of content, tribesourcing as a methodology is guided by the Protocols for American Indian Archival Materials (2006) and the groundbreaking work of Margaret Kovach (2010) and Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2012).The process of identifying narrators is best handled within the communities.Thus, paid Tribal Narration Coordinators perform the essential function of recruiting and working with narrators on-site. Rhiannon Sorrell serves in this position at Diné College in Tsaile, Arizona. Having done the very first counter-narration as proof-of-concept for the Tribesourcing project, Sorrell is well-equipped to explain the project to potential narrators and oversee recordings and payments for narrators. She will give her perspective in our presentation.From its inception, this project has existed at the crossroads of indigenous studies, film and media studies, and public digital humanities. The content resides with our Native partners; dissemination and access occur through this digital humanities project that we steward. Close collaboration with Native Nations helps to ensure cultural competency in information management, and Mukurtu’s incorporation of a digital toolset (Google maps, HTML5 video and audio players, linked data capabilities, and integration with third-party streaming platforms) afford us the means of reaching a broad user base in Indian Country, where geographical distances often inhibit access to primary materials. The new narrations, metadata, dictionary, and Traditional Knowledge Labels, when placed literally alongside films themselves, help to subvert the films’ original narrative conventions, and provoke the viewer to question the visual and spoken rhetoric (Posner, 2016). As a film preservation project, we also acknowledge “‘precious fragments’ of indigenous knowledge are increasingly held captive in obsolete audio-visual media formats” (Lawson, 2017). Therefore, issues of data migration and storage are integral to the project as well. Digitalized originals and access copies are distributed geographically, and the original films are housed at the Library of Congress.The undertaking of positioning the Tribesourcing Southwest Film Project as an interactive, multimedia, multiethnic, and polyvocal resource raises both workaday and theoretical issues, among them the need for Native language presence in the archive as a whole. Informed, intentional practice is essential. Thus, every stage of the project requires consultation and collaboration with our partners in Native Nations. This project seeks to contribute to ongoing efforts to decolonize the archive and restore voice and narrative sovereignty to the people who appear in these films—as agents of their own information rather than subjects of a governmental or corporate agenda. Participation, Equity, and Inclusion are central to this project. This project is supported by a grant from the (U.S.) National Endowment for the Humanities.","msdollman@unc.edu, jenkinsj@email.arizona.edu, rsorrell@dinecollege.edu",Long Presentation

The core concept of NewsEye is a seamlessly integrated armory of tools and methods that will improve the users’ capability to access, analyze and use the content in the digital libraries of historical newspapers.Figure 1: Beta version of the NewsEye demonstrator (June 2020)Specifically, in the context of historical newspaper written in German, Finnish, Swedish and French, with a focus on the period 1850-1950, the project aims to develop a toolbox consisting of two main layers, as well as novel research results on several topics and in several fields of digital humanities, based on documents in different languages, so as to demonstrate the potential extent of its usefulness as a catalyst for the seamless development of novel research.In details, the first layer of the NewsEye toolbox focuses on tools to improve and enrich historical newspapers, with improved text recognition and article segmentation, followed by semantic enrichment through the recognition and linking of named entities, stance detection, as well as novelty detection. A language-independent set of higher quality data results from this step, already allowing an enriched experience and access to the newspaper collections. The second layer of the toolbox provides ways to benefit from this enriched dataset, through dynamic text analysis tools interacting with respect to user activities: contextualized topic modeling, viewpoint and comparative analysis, etc. In addition, an innovative personal research assistant is able to design strategies (plans) for finding something interesting and to revise them on the fly when needed. It consists of an investigator (dynamically finding and suggesting novel ideas), a reporter (summarizing the grounds for all suggestions) and an explainer (allowing the user to understand the suggestions by herself, and to return to the original data to confirm or infirm them).Within the project, several digital humanities case studies are led, with the aim to guide the development of adequate tools, and so as to demonstrate their potential for the development of novel research in digital humanities. In the case studies, groups of humanities scholars carry out investigations for representative research issues, such as “gender”, “migration”, “nationalism and revolutions”, and “media”. Since there is plenty of existing qualitative research on these topics, the project strives towards making an impact in the fields of historical research and digital humanities by combining knowledge from qualitative analyses with new findings in big data analyses provided by the new tools in this project.Figure 2: Short description of the case study on return migrationIt is essential to understand that the NewsEye research topics and datasets are showcases, and that the seamless inclusion of additional research question is a key ambition. With this in mind, all the tools developed are language-independent, so as to be able to seamlessly integrate further datasets. In fact, NewsEye is both open to further research cases to be studied using its tools and to the integration of additional datasets and tools through the status of associated partner.Acknowledgements:This work has been supported by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant 770299 (NewsEye).","antoine.doucet@univ-lr.fr, martin.gasteiner@univie.ac.at, mark.granroth-wilding@helsinki.fi, max.kaiser@onb.ac.at, minna.kaukonen@helsinki.fi, roger.labahn@uni-rostock.de, jean-philippe.moreux@bnf.fr, guenter.muehlberger@uibk.ac.at, eva.pfanzelter@uibk.ac.at, marie-eve.therenty@univ-montp3.fr, hannu.toivonen@helsinki.fi, mikko.tolonen@helsinki.fi",Poster

In 2019, the CDRH challenged itself with migrating the entire WCA to an Orchid-powered application — a strong proof-of-concept that Orchid was equally suited to the task of hosting complex existing projects as well as new sites.The first obstacle to migrating the WCA site was that Orchid had not been built for the complexity of sites such as the WCA. The site draws from overlapping sets of documents with differing displays and behavior, so the new application required both a site-wide search in addition to the existing Complete Letters search functionality. In order to address this challenge, Orchid logic was altered to support multiple sections of websites with customizable browsing options, search defaults, interfaces, and internationalization.7 This was engineered to re-use as much of the existing Orchid code and require as little additional configuration and code in the application as possible.Figure 1: Screenshots of the site-wide WCA search (left) and The Complete Letters search (right). Differences include the ability to search annotations separately, different filters, a custom display, and a search by letter identifier.This multi-section functionality is predicted to be utilized by complex sites slated for upgrade from older technologies, such as The Walt Whitman Archive.8 Perhaps most exciting of all, the multi-section functionality of Orchid brings us closer to a long-term goal of the CDRH to offer simple interfaces for engaging with older documents from dozens of projects available as sub-sites in a single, centralized application.","jdussault@unl.edu, techgique@unl.edu, kdalziel@unl.edu",Poster

These policies have been reinforced by building software with expectations about data location, which makes creating, maintaining, and upgrading sites more manageable. This paper examines the structural changes of organizing files, the impact on workflow, and the increased accessibility of data for researchers.File Organization    The CDRH’s largest and most well-known projects are document-driven digital archives, producing tens of thousands of encoded TEI-XML3 files. Historically, these files were part of a website's code base, but projects shared no common structure. The first step towards managing data for dozens of projects was to move the documents out of website code into ""data repositories.""4 Datura5, CDRH-developed software, provides customizable scripts for transforming a data repository's documents into other formats, such as HTML or JSON for search indexes. The location of documents is enforced by Datura's expectations of file types.Figure 1: The basic structure of a data repository. The source documents, stored in subdirectories by type, are transformed by scripts which apply overrides and configuration settings into files in the output directory. Most commonly, TEI files are transformed into HTML for display or JSON for populating search indexes.Images are stored separately from the website served with an International Image Interoperability Framework-compatible image server.6 These changes to data and image locations allow us to focus on standardizing other aspects of our websites, such as publishing documents with a center-wide API.WorkflowThis Datura-driven standardization has led to improvements in project workflow. Students and other researchers can be commonly trained on file naming and data structures. They are trained to use a version control system, currently git hosted on GitHub, allowing easier access to file sharing and virtually eliminating data being lost or overwritten. Previously students working on multiple projects needed training on each project as to where metadata files and images were stored, scan specifications, file naming, and file sharing. Now students can work across projects with little to no learning curve for each new project.Increased AccessibilityThe CDRH has a commitment to making data available for scholars. We have long exposed XML source files powering individual pages7, but the new data repository system makes downloading and working with project files even easier. The CDRH publishes data repositories on the code-sharing platform GitHub, tagged with ""tei-xml"" to aid discoverability.8 These public repositories can be downloaded or referenced remotely. An artist has already used repository documents to power a small site.9 The public repositories also provide student contributors with a resource to showcase their project work.10ConclusionThough this system has drawbacks that we will discuss during our presentation, our data-first approach has dramatically decreased development time spent on creating websites and on student training. Gathering documents together has improved the internal workflow of collaborators, laid the groundwork for future initiatives to renovate aging websites, and aided in the dissemination of data and scholarship to researchers around the globe. Discussion around designing Digital Humanities projects to enable future support is increasingly important in the discipline. Typically, each project has a single data repository, but in the case of larger and more complex projects like The Walt Whitman Archive, a project may have multiple data repositories to group documents with different concerns like marginalia or scribal documents.","jdussault@unl.edu, lweakly2@unl.edu",Short Presentation

Linked Jazz, for example, continues to demonstrate how discoveries can aid libraries and archives in re-imagining the representation of their holdings that contain music. The recently published Linked Irish Traditional Music project (or LITMUS), is further testimony to value of Linked Data and the importance of building specific ontologies for Irish traditional music, song and dance.In this presentation, I introduce Connections in Sound, a linked data case study that was focused on exploring Irish traditional music in audio collections from the American Folklife Center (AFC) at the Library of Congress. The project team worked closely with reference librarians to identify metadata from fieldworker and recordist documentation and transcribing audio data from a range of performance contexts. The resultant wide range of metadata allowed us to make connections between and unite metadata descriptions of audio material that had previously existed within separate sections of the archive. The case study demonstrates the particularities of a range of metadata, formats and fieldwork methods from material in collections that span the twentieth century at the AFC.Connections in Sound pilots a number of digital methods such as data gathering and structuring to examine how material from disparate sources may be brought together and visualised with the digital re-combination of metadata. Connections in Sound progressed in an iterative, experimental way for a) gaining insight into the possibilities of utilizing current resources for digital semantic description within the genre and b) understanding limitations of these current resources as identified during data analysis and gathering.This pilot seeks to contribute to discussions on what is specific about Irish traditional music that can inform how we might progress with Linked Data, for best practices, methods for analyzing, gathering and representing data. In so doing, Connections in Sound attempts to relay insight into understanding the opportunities and challenges that arise when developing linked data resources for Irish traditional music, and traditional music in general. It suggests potentials for continued research in this area and offers insight into advancements for Linked Data with traditional music in general.The project is also supported up by a survey of musicians across North America who perform Irish traditional music in order to understand the nuances of their interaction with sound files from archives such as those within the American Folklife Center.",patrick.egan@student.ucc.ie,Lightning

However, most of these resources gloss over a tension at the core of implementing PM for DH: that the functionalist models from which PM is drawn is incompatible with the nature of humanistic inquiry. There is an opportunity to adopt a more critical project management approach, and to leverage PM methodologies not only for effectiveness and efficiency, but to establish a project’s intellectual, ethical, social and political values. This workshop explores the notion of critical DH PM by focusing on a foundational best-practice: the project charter. We will introduce the charter as having two-fold importance: 1) it provides the project’s organizational infrastructure and 2) it defines and embodies a commitment to a set of values, providing space to negotiate topics like equity and fair labor, accountability, accessibility, sustainability and community practices. Charters are social, setting the tone for collaborative work and establishing the terms on which the project engages the public. Workshop participants will be provided a template and opportunity to draft and get feedback on their own charters. Additionally, we will discuss and reflect on the charter as a writing and thinking process, engaging with ideas circulating in the DH community such as Ethics of Care/Carework (e.g. Suomela, et al, 2019, and Klein, 2015) and “critical management studies” in the project management community (e.g. Hodgson and Cicmil, 2008).","nataliae@princeton.edu, rmunson@Princeton.EDU, ajanco@haverford.edu",Workshop/Tutorial 2

À l’issue de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, on assiste à un progressif phénomène de commercialisation du savoir qui change la nature de ce dernier (Guédon et Loute 2017). L’intervention du numérique ouvre à nouveau des possibilités de changement du savoir, tout en en accentuant l’aspect commercial (Kaplan 2014). La présence des grands acteurs commerciaux du web, que l’on peut cerner approximativement avec l’acronyme GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft), ainsi que la montée en puissance de cinq éditeurs académiques en SHS (Elsevier, Taylor&Francis, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, Sage, cf. Larivière, Haustein, et Mongeon 2015), sont une manifestation claire de cette intensification opérée par la conjonction du numérique et du commercial : elle produit un effet quasi-hégémonique sur la connaissance et les savoirs en les assujettissant à une uniformisation linguistique et épistémologique sans précédent (Sordi et Fiormonte 2019). Dans ce cadre, l’hégémonie de l’anglais et d’une vision du monde propre à certaines élites nord-américaines (Morozov 2012, 2013) est déjà la réalité de notre époque et menace de s’amplifier dans un futur proche (Wormser 2018).Comment contrer ce modèle ? Comment garantir que les savoirs de demain soient fondés sur une pluralité de visions du monde, de langues et de cultures ? Comment faire en sorte que ces savoirs ne soient pas orientés par les intérêts commerciaux, et conservent bien une dimension publique et collective ?Ces questions sont au centre du projet de développement partenariat Revue 2.0 (dont les résultats préliminaires sont disponibles sur le site http://revue20.org). Cette vaste enquête, menée en partenariat avec les principaux acteurs de l’édition savante francophone en sciences humaines (SH), nous a démontré que les revues, en tant que reflet de communautés de recherche, constituaient de véritables lieux d’expérimentation de nouvelles formes de production du savoir. Historiquement, elles ont su s’adapter à différents paradigmes. Elles ont été des ateliers de la pensée dans le monde de l’imprimé en créant par exemple des formats de diffusion originaux selon le contexte matériel ; dans un domaine comme celui des SH où la forme monographique reste le support privilégié et le plus institutionnel pour diffuser les résultats d’une recherche (Larivière et Lobet 2018), les revues ont su expérimenter et innover, ouvrir des espaces autres, permettre la conversation et le dialogue au sein des communautés scientifiques (Vitali-Rosati 2018). Elles ont garanti l’existence d’une multiplicité d’approches, de modèles épistémologiques et de visions du monde. Or, là où l’on pouvait penser que les revues devaient mieux opérer leur remédiation pour s’adapter à l’environnement numérique, nous avons au contraire compris grâce à l’enquête Revue 2.0, que de par leur multiplicité et leur diversité, les revues peuvent contribuer à la richesse et à la diversité des environnements numériques, aujourd’hui constitués en un espace hégémonique.Le projet Revue 2.0 vise à repenser le rôle des revues savantes dans les sciences humaines et sociales et à accompagner les acteurs de l’édition scientifique dans leur transition numérique, pour faire en sorte que les revues savantes en SH restent les protagonistes des savoirs de demain, en garantissant ainsi dans l’espace numérique une pluralité de modèles, de langues et de cultures, tout en préservant la dimension publique des savoirs.Les revues sont un terrain d’expérimentation privilégié pour imaginer de nouveaux modes de production, diffusion et légitimation du savoir à l’époque du numérique (Vitali-Rosati 2014) qui permettent de relever un défi décisif : préserver la possibilité d’une connaissance multiple et plurielle et rester les acteurs au fondement des différents modèles épistémologiques qui structurent le savoir.Au début des années 1990, la naissance des premiers diffuseurs scientifiques numériques comme Muse a été suivie dans le domaine francophone par la création d’OpenEdition ou d’Érudit. Il était alors question de convaincre les revues d’investir les environnements numériques. Vingt ans plus tard, comme nous l’a démontré le projet Revue 2.0, ce passage a été accompli, et les revues se sont inscrites dans des écosystèmes de diffusion qui, par contre, ne prennent pas suffisamment en compte leurs spécificités. Les revues réalisent aujourd’hui que pour conserver leur diversité éditoriale et épistémologique, il est nécessaire de questionner ces écosystèmes et d’imaginer de nouveaux modèles, en évitant l’homogénéisation. Si les vingt dernières années ont été celles du passage au numérique, les dix prochaines seront celles de l’émergence de nouveaux régimes de connaissance et de la diversification des espaces numériques.","antoine.fauchie@umontreal.ca, margot.mellet@umontreal.ca, servanne.monjour@gmail.com, nicolas.sauret@umontreal.ca, marcello.vitali-rosati@umontreal.ca",Poster

Its non-functional requirements respond mainly to flexibility (accept different text inputs) and optimisation (produce rich visualisations with minimal set up). The visual outputs produced by the application have an explorative function in that they aim to:offer a different perspective on the text under study;highlight patterns and/or outliers (Meirelles 2013);drive research in formulating new hypotheses;provide support to, or disprove, existing theses.The current version accounts for modules (i.e. software components) designed around one selected test case, namely Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy, but serves as a blueprintfor further modules to be plugged in.The Italian version of the Commedia (Petrocchi 1966-67) is used to perform text structural analysis and work on the rhyme scheme, while the English translation (Mandelbaum 1980-84) is used for sentiment analysis. The unique way in which Dante wrote his masterpiece, makes the text an interesting dataset to be explored computationally. Structural (spatial and temporal) textual components lend themselves to be represented graphically, and offer insights into its linguistic content.The visual outputs allows users to interact with both the content and the metadata.The application performs computational text analysis to produce data visualisations representing the following structural, stylistic and semantic features of the text:schematic representation of the poem’s structure and rhythm ;distribution of keywords;visual representation of the sentiment analysis (fig. 3).Figure 1 An example of the schematic representation of the poem’s structure: rhythm imposed by tercets and rhyme prediction.Figure 2 Words like Cristo (Christ) and stelle (stars) are distributed unevenly across the three cantiche: the word “Christ” never appears in the Inferno, while it’s widely used in the Paradiso. One square per line. Figure 3 Sentiment analysis visualisation of the three cantiche. Red is negative, blue is positive and the opacity indicates how close to the polarity (-1, 1) the sentiment is. One square per line.The application has been developed modularly (Martin and Martin 2006), following the separation of concerns design principle (Dijkstra 1982) to allow for flexibility and scalability.The computational aspect of the project is implemented in Python, a flexible programming language that supports object-oriented programming and functional paradigms.The visualisations are produced with the support of d3.js library, “a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data” (Bostock D3.js <https://d3js.org/>). The application exploits HTML5 and SVG specifications to allow for greater interaction and portability.Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques have been applied to process and transform the data. The Naive Bayes Classifier (Perkins 2010) technique has been chosen due to its performance and simple implementation.A training dataset has been manually created collecting random subsets of text from other authors close in language and time, and further work from Dante himself:Ludovico Ariosto, Orlando furioso (Wikisource contributors 2012)Dante Alighieri, Convivio (Gallarino <http://www.italica.it/dante/convivio.html>)Giovanni Boccaccio, Decamerone (Wikisource contributors 2017)The poster illustrates the workflow from input to output, displaying a diagram of the process.The poster demonstrates achievements of this proof of concept and development ideas for the future. The main success lies in its modular development (fig. 4), making it amenable to further development3 (algorithm refinements, visualisation workflows, stylometric analysis). More languages and different text structures will be integrated and a wider range of output visualisations offered, while making use of the same core functionalities for ingesting and processing data.Figure 4 The data model of the application, illustrating the separation of concerns andthe potential for extensibility.",ginestra.ferraro@kcl.ac.uk,Poster

The abundance of dramas revolving around the Faust myth will serve as an example.The German Drama Corpus (https://dracor.org/ger) currently holds 18 TEI-encoded plays that centre around a Faust character. They range from early plays like Weidmann's ""Johann Faust"" (1775) to the two parts of Goethe's ""Faust"" (1808, 1832) and Friedrich Theodor Vischer's ""Faust, part III"" (1862), but also feature mash-ups like Grabbe's ""Don Juan und Faust"" (1829) and a version with a female Faust character, Wilhelm Schäfer's ""Faustine"" (1898).Network analysis enables us to take a comparative macroscopic look at the different structures of these plays. For example, the roles of the devil/sub-devil Mephistopheles and the famulus Wagner can be examined more closely, shedding new light on the structural development of the sujet. It will become clear when and where these characters appear – but also where they are missing. Other types of characters also come to the fore, such as Gretchen or even Faust's parents, who play no role in Goethe's version but who do appear in other plays.Our poster first offers network visualisations that concentrate on the centres, i.e., the constellation directly around the Faust character, especially in the larger plays (Soden's ""Doctor Faust"" has 62 characters, Julius von Voss's ""Faust"" has 72 characters, Avenarius' ""Faust"" has 95 characters, Goethe's first part of ""Faust"" has 115 and the second part even 189 distinguishable characters/voices). The visualisations are supported by statistical network measures, such as the Betweenness Centrality, Degree and Weighted Degree. In addition to visual evidence, these measures can also address the positioning of the characters surrounding Faust in a new way.The poster will demonstrate how network analytical and quantitative aspects complement existing literary research on the topic (for an overview of the wealth of literary works around Faust cf. Hucke 1992).","frank.fischer@dariah.eu, annabusch@uni-potsdam.de, heyden.linda@gmail.com, info@markschwindt.com",Poster

This abstract highlights our recent work on poetry identification from Internet Archive books and the public resources (code, data and models) that exist as a result. We hope that this is the beginning of deeper and richer research into poetry in the digital humanities because curating custom collections of poetry should be less expensive.Poetry in Digital LibrariesDigital libraries have expanded rapidly in quantity and quality of content over the past decade. Out-of-copyright and public domain works are available from the inventing of the printing press all the way to the early twentieth century.Unfortunately, this explosion in content has not quite connected all the way to different genres: large collections of poetry are not available because they are typically curated manually.The intersection of poetry and digital methods is actually fairly common and has been studied in a diverse set of languages and cultures e.g., Bangla (Rakshit et al., 2015), Arabic (Ahmed and Trausan-Matu, 2017) and Thai (Promrit and Waijanya, 2017). Features of poetry have also been studied using computational methods, e.g, meter (Hamidi et al., 2009), style (Baumann et al., 2018), authorship and time (Can et al., 2011), emotion (Alsharif et al., 2013; Barros et al., 2013; Kumar and Minz, 2014), and even content (Jamal et al., 2012; Choi et al., 2016; Lou et al., 2015; Kesarwani, 2018). Kaur an Saini’s recent work on classifying Punjabi poems into four categories is not a survey, but does provide a table of recent work, language targeted, and features discussed (2017).However, most of these works use small datasets (10s-100s of poems), because the cost of collecting and curating poetry is so high. There is a lot of poetry available in digital libraries, but it’s effectively hidden in those books.Automatic Extraction of PoetryUnderwood et al. (2013) present a study of genre in Hathi Trust books, and one of their genres is poetry, which they extend to page level labels in later work (Underwood, 2014). Other recent work uses image classification approaches (Lorang et al., 2015), focuses on Australian newspapers (Kilner and Fitch, 2017) or is language-specific on a small collection (Tizhoosh et al., 2008).These existing approaches cannot be cleanly applied to discover poems such as this poem about “Sweet Peas” that our algorithm identified in the middle of a gardening guide (Figure 1).Figure 1: A Poem printed in the middle of a Gardening Guide (Rockwell et al., 1917). This is the kind of “hidden” poetry our algorithm was designed to target.Drawing inspiration and ideas from these works, we formulated the poetry identification problem: does a given scanned book page contain poetry on it?Using a few thousand labeled pages as training data and only language-independent features, we developed a new model for poetry identification. This model is both effective (F1 = 0.83) and efficient (500,000 books/hour - single machine). It runs on DJVU-XML books from the Internet Archive.Public Resources, Code, & Open DataWe released a variety of public resources. There is a dataset of our identification task as well as a JSON-formatted collection of 600,000 pages identified to contain poetry from a random selection of 50,000 books. Our model is available and our methodology can be found in more detail in my dissertation (Foley, 2019).Datasets: http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/poetryCode & Model: https://github.com/jjfiv/poetry-identificationDemo: https://poetry.jjfoley.me",jjfoley@smith.edu,Poster

The examination moves from high-level essays describing the genre and history of Noh and the two plays to a middle-level set of interactive catalogs, descriptions, and image, video and audio examples presenting the varied and often highly systematized media elements that comprise a Noh performance. These include theatrical and dramatic forms at the macro and meso scales, poetic modes of declamation and singing, dance patterns and other gestures, instruments, rhythmic and melodic modes and musical forms, as well as costumes, masks, stage positioning and props.Fig. 1: A faceted catalog of shōdan (formal sections of a play)At the most finely detailed level, the project provides a novel playback and annotation environment that is synchronized at subsecond-level granularity with the streaming video playback, combining plot synopses, visualizations of formal sections, and synchronized libretto translations with a multilayered, multimedia score that encodes every sung or spoken word, musical element, and stage action. This score thus represents, for a specific performance, even the components of a play that are not traditionally notated, such as elements of the musical accompaniment. In an analogous manner, this entire mode of presentation has the effect of exposing, in an immediately engaging and comprehensible way, the myriad subtle details of a Noh performance whose interplay across media types lends the performances their extraordinary richness, yet which would otherwise likely go unremarked by those who are not already experts in the genre.Fig. 2: The interactive playback environment, with synchronized score, text, formal map and descriptionThe site also engages with the tensions between providing interactive, multimedia visualization and annotation features that are highly tailored to a specific performance genre (Noh, in this case) versus having the flexibility to accommodate other genres and art forms within the same framework. In our project, we found that favoring the specific over the general provided the greatest degree of interpretive insight, but it consequently required a greater effort to integrate other genres, particularly if these other forms are to be presented at equivalent levels of coherence and clarity.","tfujita@kcua.ac.jp, jkapusci@stanford.edu, frose@stanford.edu, scottbailey@stanford.edu, broadwell@stanford.edu, simon.wiles@stanford.edu, gworthey@stanford.edu",Poster

If scholars have already tried to measure the proportion that has survived since the apparition of moveable types with Gutenberg [Weitzman, 1987], such percentages do not help editors of texts to answer a more practical question: how many documents of a given author still exist, and among them how many are accessible to scholars?In the present paper, we want to use Madame de Sévigné (1626-†1696) as a test case to calculate how many autograph manuscripts (AM) are still circulating on the market, and therefore assess precisely what is inaccessible because it is held in private collections by combining three different sources of information. First, a list of French AM held in libraries – which has been created for the occasion, because there is no catalogue for French literature such as the one by P. Beal [2005]. Second, a list of Sévigné’s AM held in historical private collections, drawn from Duchêne’s edition [Sévigné, 1972-1978]. Third, a list of manuscripts drawn from fixed-price and auction catalogues [Bodin, 2000], which contains the description of hundreds of thousands of manuscripts sold over decades (fig. 1).1. QuantificationExisting manuscripts (E) of an author (a) are either kept accessible in libraries and archives (L), either (more or less) hidden in private collections (C). The problem is that while we know L, for which we have catalogues, C is unknown. To know what it represents, we can divide it in two: on the one hand we have historical collections (H), usually inherited by old families, well documented and extremely static, and on the other hand there is an unknown amount of documents circulating between private collectors (P). If we cannot know P, we can use a proxy: we can deduce what is still on the market (M) by subtracting what is owned (because it has been bought) by libraries (L) from everything that has been sold (S). Because buyers are constantly intervening on the market (S), any value is only true at time t – i.e. the date of the last sale catalogue taken into account, assuming that all the previous ones have been analysed. With all these information, we can now deduce how many manuscripts still exist (E) if we know S. Figure 1: RDA, May 1894 (N°166)Looking for French AM, we have concentrated our efforts on documents sold in Paris, and for financial and time reasons, we have focused on catalogues published before c. 1900. We have retro-converted:250 fixed-price catalogues of the Revue des autographes (RDA, cf. fig. 1).300 fixed-price catalogues of the Lettres autographes et documents (LAD).100 auction catalogues.Because of similarities between such catalogues and dictionaries, we have been able to use GROBID dictionaries [Khemakhem et al., 2018] to process the images and transform them into a fully TEI-conformant semantic encoding (fig. 2) thanks to a custom workflow [Gabay et al., 2020].Figure 2: XML-TEI encoding of an entryThe workflow keeps undergoing constant improvements (e.g. Rondeau Du Noyer et al. [2019]), which have led to the creation of a dedicated tool for catalogues [Khemakhem et al., 2020]. In its last version, on top of traditional features for information extraction (special characters, position on the page... in red in fig. 3), we now use typographical information (bold, italics, size of the font... in blue in fig. 3) for more precise results. Figure 3: RDA, May 1873 (N°37)3 Annotation and reconciliation The letter previously mentioned is not the only one of Sévigné sold during the 19th c., and it has not been sold only once Figure 4: RDA, July 1897 (N°200)Figure 5: RDA, April 1902 (N°257)Because the same item can be sold multiple times, it is crucial to transform the list obtained with the digitisation of sale catalogues into a set of unique types (or classes, cf. blue and red boxes in fig. 6), prior to comparing these types with existing documents held in libraries. Doing so, we can identify AM that have never appeared on the market (in pink and in black), document the history of those that are now in library collections (in blue and in orange) or identify “ghost” manuscripts that are still circulating on the private market (in green and red). Figure 6: Reconciliation-identification processTo carry out this task, more information is required than those provided by GROBID dictionaries, we have therefore added an extra layer of information, including the type of document (L.a.s. for autograph letter signed, D.s. signed document...), its length (number of pages or folios...), its format (in-octavo, in-quarto...), its date or its price. Since these information follow either an extremely strict (1 p., L.a.s.... ), either a fairly common pattern (12 janvier 1798, 19 sep. 1820...), they are tagged with regexes and dedicated python libraries in order to obtain a more fine-grained encoding: Figure 7: Annotated <desc>Combined with the name of the author, such information provide a unique combination of features that can be used to compare sold documents over time, and identify not only same AM sold twice, but also different fragments of a single manuscript (tab. 1), which share part of the information only (same date, same format but different length). Table 1: Key information of three sold items from cataloguesBecause we have catalogued all the known manuscripts of the marquise de Sévigné after extensive research in European and American libraries, it is possible to reconstitute part of their history thanks to the sale catalogues. Table 2: Key information of two manuscripts ResultsWe can now offer some results:63 sales have been identified until 190346 AM being sold at least one time, 14 at least two times13 letters out of the 46 sold are not in public libraries or archivesFollowing these numbers, we can say that:c. 1% of the 1,350 letters identified by Duchêne [Sévigné, 1972-1978] are still circulating on the market.c. 5% of the total has survived but is inaccessible to scholars, if we add the 62 letters still held in the private collections of the Guitaut family in Burgundy.Such numbers, obviously, need to be taken with caution for two main reasons. On the one hand, the oldest catalogues are not precise enough to identify exactly which AM is sold. On the other hand, the market in the 19th c. is already international, and manuscripts sold outside of France are not taken into account by our study. This second problem should receive all our attention in a near future to contribute to the history of objects [Courtin, 2020], and especially the migration of manuscripts [Burrows et al., 2019].Acknowledgements Many thanks to Agathe Decaster for her (crucial) help with the mathematical formulas, and her brother Erwan.","simon.gabay@unine.ch, lucie.rondeau.du.noyer@chartes.psl.eu, matthias.gille-levenson@ens-lyon.fr, Ljudmila.Petkovic@etu.unige.ch, alexandre.bartz@chartes.psl.eu",Short Presentation

Hajdouks were outlaws living in the woods, that fascinated the public in the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century, both for their cruelty and their sense of justice. Between 1840 and 1920, they appear in almost 12% of the Romanian novels, with at least 40 titles specifically dedicated to this picturesque character.Our main concern is “the place-making mediated by the text”, and more precisely the creation of a Hajdouk space; in a rural Romania, structured by clear and stable relationships between spaces, their nomadic way of life constitutes a disrupting force, and we are looking at if and how this reflects in the novels. Much along the lines of (Hay and Butterworth 2019), our work focuses less on the “indexical relationship to the physical world”, and more on the ways in which the texts create their own spatiality.In the first part, we discuss the adaptation of Pustejovsky’s ISO metamodel (2014, 2019) to operate what we call a “basic annotation” of our set of novels. Faced with the specificities of our texts, we have defined not two, but seven types of spatial entities: toponyms, places, paths, zones, vehicles, topical spaces and potential spaces. The two last categories are the most salient difference between our annotation schema and the previous existing ones, and we advocate their interest in literary contexts, where “the other world” or “in his bosom” are frequently mentioned, to quote but two examples from a very rich list.We further characterize the spaces as “absolute” or “relative”. For this “basic annotation”, we have renounced to define other types of relations, such as orientation, movement or metrics.The annotation exercise took place in two phases. In a first, exploratory round, we have worked on XML files, and implemented our schema as a feature structure in TEI. In a second round, we have configured a BRAT server and started by measuring the inter-annotator agreement on a set of 10 samples of about 1000 words (see results in Galleron et al., forthcoming). In a third phase, currently under development, we proceed to the actual annotation of texts, using a place names dictionary to pre-annotate. Another path currently explored is that of the syntactic tagging of phrase constituents: since a large part of our space entities appear to assume a function of circumstantial complement of place, they could be spotted with a specialized dependencies tagger. However, the first experiences in this respect are quite disappointing, and all the more so they have been conducted on samples in French – results will probably be worse on Romanian samples, since Romanian is a language less equipped with NLP tools. Please note that usual NER systems (Stanford, Spacy library, etc.) do not work, or give very poor results, on Romanian texts. For all these reasons, manual annotation still appears as the best way to go, in spite of being extremely time consuming.To date, the repartition of the annotations per type, as indicated in figure 1, confirms that looking at toponyms only, with a NER/ NEL approach, fails to capture a large part of the placemaking process in a novel. Also, two major categories of novels seem to appear with regards to the writing of the space, one constituted by the texts in which places and zones are in even proportions, the other gathering novels in which places are dominant, to the detriment of zones.Figure 1. Annotations per type in a selection of novelsIn addition, categories “paths” and “vehicles” seem to be discriminant between two other types of fiction. Indeed, while the number of annotations remains quite low in both cases, they allow to identify certain novels as outliers, with lots of spatial changes, as opposed to the major part of novels that appear finally more “static”, and privileging scenes and summaries of the action. This is somewhat surprising, since we expected all our Hajdouk novels to pertain to the second category. We are currently trying to understand if the difference is motivated by the specific style of certain authors, the taste of an era, or it genuinely points towards a generic specificity within our corpus;","ioana.galleron@sorbonne-nouvelle.fr, roxana.patras@uaic.ro, cameliagradinaru2013@gmail.com",Lightning

In addition to general problems (creation of suitable dictionaries, recognition of negations and other dependency-related changes in meaning), the high complexity of literary language and text structure as well as the considerably higher number of potential opinion targets or holders of sentiment (cf. Liu 2012: 18) are problematic.In comparison to the still challenging high complexity of language (i.e., metaphors, irony, and other forms of improper speech), tackling text structure and sentiment holders seems more straightforward. A feasible use of sentiment analysis rooted in literary studies should therefore combine (i) simple, but established procedures for sentiment analysis with (ii) more elaborate understandings of texts and their entities.We tried to implement this by developing the approach presented in this contribution. With two adjustments we made sentiment analysis more adequate for literary text analysis:Segmentation: Since text segmentation should correspond to hermeneutic text approaches, we only analyze segments that are relevant for character analysis (for now: character speech) and combine them with thematic aspects.3Sentiment sensitivity: Due to the problems discussed, we conduct a comparatively simple sentiment analysis ignoring the positivity or negativity of sentiment values. We thus determine what we regard as sentiment sensitivity. Thereby, we avoid both attributing false sentiment values to negations or improper speech and positive and negative values cancelling each other out.ImplementationFor our two experiments we automatically extracted direct speech and manually annotated speakers for six exemplary texts from corpora of the hermA project4. We also created the semantic fields 'state and society' and 'illness'.5 Then a sentiment value was determined for each speech segment consisting of the sum of all values provided by the SentiWS sentiment lexicon (Remus et al. 2010), normalized by their number. Finally, speech segments including words from the pertaining semantic fields were identified. Figure 1: example of sentiment analysis in character speech based on semantic fields (Zeh: Corpus Delicti, crosses indicating semantic field segments)Thus, we analyzed when, to what extent and with which sentiment values character speak as well as their relation to certain topics. The results concerning our research interests are sketched briefly below.Example 1: Gender and IllnessIn our first experiment with novels from around 1900, general sentiment sensitivity resulted higher for male than for female characters (cf. Table 1 and Figure 2). Interestingly, this difference almost levels out in segments containing the semantic field 'illness'. Therefore, while showing general differences between female and male speech around 1900, our sentiment approach proves useful for looking closer at the relation between gender and certain topics as well. Table 1: Overview of annotations and sentiment scores of Aus guter Familie, Das kleine Glück und Ellernklipp Figure 2: sentiment sensitivity of female and male characters from Aus guter Familie, Das kleine Glück und Ellernklipp (general and semantic field (sf)-related values) Example 2: Dystopias as GenreIn the second experiment we examined whether in contemporary dystopian novels the presumably crucial semantic field of state and society is sentiment sensitive. The values in Table 2 show that character speech about state and society in dystopias tends to be emotionalized. Thus, topic-related sentiment sensitivity seems to be an interesting feature for the automatic detection of dystopia as a genre.Table 2: sentiment sensitivity of character speech (with and without affiliation to the semantic field of ‘state and society’) in dystopian novelsIn summary, our concept of sentiment sensibility, as calculated by sentiment analysis, seems to be an appropriate way of dealing with the ambiguity of literary texts and the interests of literary scholarship.","evelyn.gius@tu-darmstadt.de, anna-aline.murawska@uni-hamburg.de, oliver.schmidt@tuhh.de, carla.soekefeld@uni-hamburg.de, michael.vauth@tuhh.de",Lightning

Western New York and the city of Rochester were renowned for revivals and new religious movements during the Second Great Awakening, so that the region became known as the “Burned-over District.” However, Western New York’s religious history after 1850 has not received equal scholarly attention. Dr. Guillory and the graduate and undergraduate students who worked on DRR sought to fill this gap. (I served as the lead graduate student researcher.) The team wrote essays about past and present religious sites, visited religious sites and archives, and digitized sources from community archives. We sought to collaborate with local religious communities, so that DRR would build a meaningful relationship between the University and surrounding neighborhoods.Bruce Lincoln’s definition of religion, namely that a religion consists of a “discourse,” a “set of practices,” a “community,” and “an institution,” guides DRR. [Source: Bruce Lincoln, Holy Terrors: Thinking about Religion after September 11, 5–7; see 5 for “discourse,” 6 for “set of practices” and “community,” and 7 for the full quote of “an institution.”] In its attention to religious spaces and its collaborative approach to scholarship, DRR draws inspiration from Dr. Courtney Bender’s Sacred Gotham, which tasked students with mapping religious spaces in New York City. It also builds on Dr. David H. Day’s 2003 web project “Encountering Old Faiths in New Places: Mapping Religious Diversity in the Rochester, New York Area,” based at Monroe Community College. “Encountering Old Faiths” featured students’ ethnographic observations of current religious sites. DRR, by contrast, profiles past as well as present religious sites, so that it is more historical than anthropological in its orientation. Overall, DRR contributes to a growing field of public-facing projects about lived religion in U.S. cities; notable examples include Boston’s Hidden Sacred Spaces and the American Religious Sounds Project.When Dr. Guillory moved to Boston University in 2018, I took over DRR and completed it as a pilot project, documenting religious communities in Rochester’s southwester quadrant, instead of the whole city as originally planned. The website (http://digrocreligions.org/) provides a template for historians, religionists, and students to pursue this work on a larger scale. Taken together, the essays featured on DRR detail how, beginning in the 1960s, the loss of Rochester’s industrial base exacerbated racial and economic segregation. Religious organizations in the economically distressed southwestern neighborhoods filled the gap left by the withdrawal of tax dollars and government services. By launching job programs, soup kitchens, and clinics, religious groups in southwest Rochester tried to meet the physical and material as well as spiritual needs of residents.Had COVID-19 not required the cancellation of DH2020, my lightning talk would have reviewed DRR’s public and digital history aspects and provided a tour of the website. I would have discussed the importance of developing reciprocal relationships with community partners (in our case, religious congregations), although we were not fully successful. After I took over the project, the priority became finishing it, so that I only used publicly available documents instead of archival sources to finish several essays. As for digital humanities technology, I would have discussed the workflow of scanning, formatting, cataloguing, and compressing 80 gigabytes’ worth of primary sources for the website. Finally, I would have presented DRR as an example of successful project-based learning, since the students who worked on DRR gained hands-on archival, ethnographic, and digital humanities experience.",dgormanj@ur.rochester.edu,Lightning

However, to understand the multidimensionality of the data requires a consequent reflection on its modeling.This paper seeks to be part of a series of publications aimed at making advanced network analysis concepts more accessible to the humanities scholars: from ontological questions (Langmead et al. 2016) to the necessary discussion of the integration of temporality in graphs (Lemercier 2015; Conroy et al. 2019), the development of typologies of uses (Grandjean 2017a) or attempts to provide aids to interpretation (Grandjean & Jacomy 2019). The question of multilayer networks becomes especially more and more important, whether in a general way (McGee et al. 2016) or applied to the humanities (eg. Vugt 2017; Grandjean 2017b).Our purpose is to discuss a unifying conceptual framework allowing the transition between a current formal multilayer model (Kivelä et al. 2014; Knudsen et al. 2019) and the language of the humanities. This framework is expressed by a visual representation that contains a multiplicity of layers that synthesizes and clarifies the different possible networks and facilitate the appropriation of the model by researchers.Description of the frameworkThe key element of this concept is the distinction between “layers” and “levels”: within a horizontal level, 1-mode graphs all have the same set (and type) of nodes (visualized with a fixed position or not, depending on our will to represent the different structures or to help keeping the “mental map” between each other). A level is therefore a multiplex system of layers. The levels can be connected together by edges that express the relation between two types of nodes (2-mode).It is to be noted that the formal model does not imply a hierarchy between layers. Here, this verticality is only a visual artifact to facilitate the expression of all kind of humanities datasets. Each level represents one entity type and relationships within. It can have many layers organized by “aspects” and include edges between these layers. The inter-level relations can be represented on a layer that contains a 2-mode network (which can also be deployed according to different aspects).Figure 1: Multilayer network system made of three 1-mode networks organised on three layers set (“levels”) connected by two 2-mode networks. At each level, this representation explicit the possibility of developing the graph depending on (at least) two aspects.The visual expression of this framework (fig. 1) looks quite similar to an OLAP Graph Cube (Zhao et al. 2011) or a Space-Time Cube Visualization (Bach et al. 2014). The proposed framework is however not a cube: this well aligned appearance is a convenient way of representing things to make them less abstract so that they can be used to discuss modeling issues. Not all levels necessarily have the same dimensions and do not need to be aligned. Moreover, there can be more than three axes since it is an intellectual tool and not a graphic construction.Use casesThis visual convention allows to design “scenarios” where the model coincides with data from applied research to make the layers within them explicit:  Affiliation networks (fig. 2.1) based on interlocking data with multiple companies, institutions, prosopographic categories (eg. David & Westerhuis 2014).Character networks (fig. 2.2) based on theatre plays with addition of information on groups, families, temporality (eg. Xanthos et al. 2016).Circulation networks (fig. 2.3) with multiple transportation means, places, goods, routes, letters (eg. Orengo & Livarda 2016).Figure 2: Modeling example of an affiliation network (1), a character network (2) and a circulation network (3).",martin.grandjean@unil.ch,Short Presentation

La langue française au Québec se distingue par ses nombreuses particularités qui l’éloignent du français standard. Depuis leur séparation au 18ème siècle, les deux variétés françaises, en l’occurrence celle du Québec et celle de l’Hexagone, se sont développées indépendamment. Cependant, la littérature québécoise s’est enrichie d’un lexique marqué par des singularités linguistiques nombreuses comme des archaïsmes, des anglicismes, des néologismes et des régionalismes. De multiples recherches sociolinguistiques se sont attachées à relever les différences lexicales dans le vocabulaire du franco-québécois comparé au français dit standard international (cf. Meney 2010, 2017; Remysen et al. 2016).Désormais, les nouvelles méthodes numériques offrent des opportunités innovantes qui permettent des analyses quantitatives. Les études linguistico-littéraires fondent désormais leurs recherches sur l’analyse de corpus numériques. Ces corpus conçus à partir d’œuvres littéraires formant ainsi une source de données textuelles constituent une base pour une analyse de fréquence et de la distribution du vocabulaire propre à une variété linguistique.Le projet pilote ici décrit se trouve au carrefour de ces deux littératures: française et franco-québécoise. Il s’occupe des particularités et des différences résultant de l’évolution respective des deux variétés françaises qui se sont manifestées depuis leur séparation. En comparant les œuvres en prose du corpus, l’objectif de la recherche se focalise sur l’usage du groupe des verbes introducteurs dits verba dicendi (v.d.) utilisés pour introduire des discours directs et indirects dans des textes narratifs ainsi que pour marquer des interactions parlées ou des processus mentaux en général. L’analyse comparative dia- chronique vise à démontrer le développement du lexique et la signification sémantique des v.d. utilisés dans les œuvres littéraires écrites du 19ème siècle jusqu’au début du 20ème siècle en France et au Canada francophone.À l’aide des méthodes quantitatives, on veut démontrer qu’il y a un rapport entre l’usage préféré d’une sélection des v.d. employés pour introduire des discours et l’origine de l’auteur(e) du texte ainsi que la présence des tendances d’un usage préféré de certains v.d. dépendant de la période temporelle et de la localisation du texte. La méthodologie suit un déroulement conventionnel: Après le relevé des textes appropriés pour l’analyse, un corpus a été élaboré qui comprend 125 œuvres francophones en prose de différent(e)s auteur(e)s dont 100 œuvres françaises de l’Hexagone (prises de la French Novel Collection(ELTeC-fra)) et 20 franco-québécoises publiées entre 1837 et 1937. Ainsi, le corpus a été reparti en trois périodes temporelles au service de la comparaison diachronique. Ensuite, les textes ont été annotés avec des informations linguistiques, telles que parties de discours et lemmes. Puis, les données ont été analysées avec l’objectif de calculer la fréquence de différents v.d. employés dans les textes soit de la variété franco-québécoise soit de celle de l’Hexagone. À la base d’un algorithme qui prend en compte les particularités morphologiques des v.d. et leurs caractéristiques syntactiques, les v.d. ont été extraits et cumulés pour ainsi recevoir une liste de fréquence individuelle pour chaque période temporelle considérée. En conséquence, ces listes serviront à une comparaison diachronique focalisée sur les tendances d’usage des v.d. dans les deux littératures. En somme, cette étude contribue aux recherches sémantiques historico-diatopique de ce groupe de verbes.",Guhr@linglit.tu-darmstadt.de,Poster

Yet, one part of their content is very often neglected: the comments section.The biases induced from leaving the comments sectionEspecially when studying a corpus of websites focusing on controversial topics, commentary sections can induce many biases in the analyses. Comments can express a point of view radically different from the page itself. Hyperlinks present in the comments can point to contents that the owner of the website does not endorse, which can distort any network analysis. The vocabulary used in the comments can also bias content analyses such as topic modelling. It is thus key to eliminate these comments, or to keep them for a separate analysis. We exemplify this through a case study.Separating the comments from the page: a tedious taskRemoving or extracting the commentary sections from a set of websites is in fact a tedious task, thus rarely performed. Many languages can be used to encode the page: HTML 4.0 or 5.0, XHTML, Ajax, Ruby on Rails etc. Some standards obviously exist, for instance for blog platforms, but they are not widely adopted. And unexpected means to open a commentary section (e.g. considering the commentary sections as a subpart of a forum) can frequently occur.Aiming at exhaustivity: a necessityFocusing only on the easily retrievable commentary sections would induce important biases. The way the commentary section is encoded is in itself a socially-induced phenomenon, demonstrating the user’s literacy in web programming, or his financial means. Excluding very poorly encoded pages, or virtuoso contents written by expert programmers, could thus translate into excluding specific groups from any further analysis.A method for extracting commentsThe method we propose is not fully automated, and requires a direct identification of patterns delimiting comments sections and comments themselves in the code. Some patterns are relevant for many websites while others need to be carefully designed for a single use. We then provide an implementation with R of a code which carries out the rest of the procedure: after automated quality checks and potential improvements, links and contents coming from comments are subtracted, and the comment-free pages can be analysed. Comment sections themselves can be extracted for a separate analysis.","paul.guille.escuret@gmail.com, florian.cafiero@gmail.com, jeremy.ward.socio@gmail.com",Poster

First, we determine the probability of rhythmic contours (syllable prominence) for part of speech tags (POS tags), which allows us to establish a stress hierarchy (nouns are usually stressed, while articles are seldom stressed). Second, we determine the context dependence of rhythmic contours, by investigating when and how stress ambiguous words (like adverbs) change their stress based on their context, e.g, if a pronoun or a noun is next to it. Third, we classify poetry against prose, both on a syntactic and a rhythmic level. We do this with a linear discriminant analysis so we can interpret feature weights of POS sequences and rhythmic groups. Lastly, we look at the interaction of a simple form of enjambement with POS tags and verse measures.1 IntroductionThe verbal rendering of thought requires the choice of appropriate lexical items and their orderingaccording to the rules of syntax. Syntax, however, does not fully determine word order:speakers and writers can often choose among possible syntactic constructions when formulatingtheir message. Semantic, pragmatic, as well as phonological constraints are known toaffect wording. In spontaneous language production, semantic constraints presumably controlsentence structure more immediately and to a stronger degree than phonological constraints.This follows from the logical directionality of language production, in which the semantic contentof the message governs lexical choice and the assignment of syntactic function; phonologyand rhythm can exert their role and endow the structure with sound only once a syntacticscaffold has been constructed (Levelt, 1993).Prosody thus affects the choice of syntactic constructions and the order of constituentswithin a sentence (Anttila, 2016). The influence of prosody on syntax is most obviously attestedin metered poetry where strict metrical rules and poetic license influence word orderand grammaticality (Donat, 2010). However, for German, it is largely unclear which prosodicfactors affect sentence construction, and how strong their influence is on grammatical encoding.To analyze the interaction of syntax with meter and rhythm at scale, we make use of theGerman poetry corpus in version 4 (Haider and Eger, 2019), containing the poetry of Textgrid(textgrid.de) and the German text archive (DTA: deutschestextarchiv.de). The corpus contains59k poems over 1.6M lines. It is available at github.com/tnhaider/DLK. See Table 1for a size overview.We train Conditional Random Fields (CRF) with the sklearn crf-suite to automaticallyannotate the whole German Poetry corpus for part-of-speech (POS), binarymeter (BM), and free speech rhythm with three levels of syllable prominence (TR). To thatend, two students of linguistics / literature manually annotated 3600 lines of school canonpoetry for binary meter (BM) and ternary rhythm (TR). For POS, we rely on gold annotationfrom DTA and the TIGER Corpus, according to the STTS tagset. We train and test acrossseveral genres to determine the most robust POS model for our purposes. See Table 2 for anoverview of POS models. We find that training on TIGER is not robust to tag across domains,falling to around .8 F1-score when testing against different genres from DTA. Training on thewhole DTA or on Belletristik (fiction/literature) is however sufficient to tag poetry or fiction.See example (1) for an annotated line of poetry with BM and TR. BMincludes binary syllable prominence (+/-) and foot boundaries ( ). TR segments the verseinto rhythmic groups at caesuras (:) and in these segments allows for main accents (2), sideaccents (1), and no accents (0). The example line illustrates a regular iambic pentameter, acaesura at the comma, and two rhythmic groups of the same length but with different form.(1) <l met=""-+ -+ -+ -+ -+ "" rhythm=""01020:20102:"">Ge-duck-te Hüt-ten, Pfa-de wirr ver-streut,</l>TR differs from BM such that TR operates top-down from rhythmic segments to findfree speech rhythm, while BM adheres more to a conventional metrical poetry analysis andstarts bottom-up from syllable prominence. Annotators largely followed an intuitive notionof rhythm, and incorporated philological knowledge to consider the (schema) consistency ofthe poem. They were also instructed to prefer longer feet over short ones (where applicable).Our inter-annotator agreement is substantial. Five poems were annotated by two annotators,and calculated on each syllable, Cohen kappa for metric syllables was at .95, and .84 forrhythmic syllables. For the latter, mainly side accents (1) were confused. Caesuras alone hada kappa of .92. Metric feet were more challenging and will not be discussed here, as there aremultiple reasons why foot boundaries can be ambiguous.The CRF models are trained on syllabified lines without punctuation. The features containthe syllable tokens, including two syllables to the left and the right, and also orthographicfeatures like capitalization and characters. During training, we also allow the algorithm to see the surrounding labels (which are not available during testing). We achieve 95% F1-score for POS and BM, while TR (including caesuras) still performs well with 83% F1-score. The confusion of the model issimilar to humans who also confuse main and side accents.2 Experiments2.1 Stress HierarchyTo determine the likelihood of a word belonging to a certain POS class being stressed orunstressed, we iterate over our set of 1.6 million lines of poetry, using the CRF models toannotate the Corpus for BM and POS. For our experiments, we simplify the tagset. We thencount how often a POS tag falls into a metrically stressed or unstressed syllable. Multisyllabicwords have lexically fixed stress patterns, e.g., German words with two syllables are usuallytrochaic, where the first syllable is stressed and the second syllable is unstressed. For wordswith three syllables, we found that nouns are more likely to follow the (+,-,+) pattern, whileverbs prefer (-,+,-). Here, we only measure the prominence of monosyllabic words, whichshow the most ambiguity, as the stress of monosyllabic words is mostly determined by theircontext.Anttila et al., (2018) also determined a stress hierarchy, only for sentential stress in politicalspeeches and not on poetic lines. They are able to establish a stress hierarchy of pos-tags,such that NOUN > ADJ > VERB > FUNC. This shows that functions words (FUNC, e.g.KONJ, ART, APPR, etc) are seldom stressed, while nouns are usually stressed.Based on our corpus, we determined the following hierarchy for monosyllabic word forms(see Table 3):NOUN > VERB_modal > VERB_full > ADJ > ADV > FUNC.This hierarchy reflects the ratio r of stressed to unstressed syllables, normalized to 1. Whena POS class is equally likely to be stressed or unstressed, the r will be 1.0, or 1:1. For a ratio r= 16.0 (16:1), the word class is 16 times more likely to be stressed. We found it striking thatmodal verbs are stressed so strongly (3.8:1). We also found that monosyllabic verbs are morelikely in metrically strong positions than monosyllabic adjectives, which deviates from whatAnttila et al., (2018) found. However, the ends of the hierarchy (nouns and function words)are the same. And they do not distinguish between adverbs and adjectives and also have onlyone verb class.2.2 Context Stress AmbiguityAs words are heavily dependent on their context regarding their stress, we look at the immediateleft and right context of POS tags, i.e. which POS tag occurs next to it. For brevity,we only show the left context. We retrieve the stress ratio for particular monosyllabic wordclasses dependent on their context. Context words can be multisyllabic.See Table 4 for anoverview of nouns, modal verbs, adjectives, adverbs and demonstrative pronouns.We can see that the hierarchy from Table 3 reiterates for contextual dependence. If a wordis preceded by a conjunction (KO), then the likelihood of stress is higher. However, nouns never lose their prominence (r > 1), regardless of context. Most interestingly, adverbs, which are quite balanced, also show a balanced context dependence, while modal verbs are still mostly stressed, except when they are preceded by another modal verb. We acknowledge that this table can be problematic, such that some of these contexts seem atypical for particular word classes. Future research should investigate the frequency of particular contexts, and how significant they are.2.3 Prose vs. Poetry ClassificationTo determine features that distinguish prose from poetic writing on a syntactic and rhythmiclevel, we perform classification with a regularized linear discriminant analysis that allows us tointerpret feature loadings. Regularization is necessary, as many features are collinear, makingthe feature loadings not interpretable (as collinear features will be important for both classes,without contributing to the classification).For features, we use POS n-grams and rhythmic groups. POS n-grams are straightforward,where only subsequent POS tags are considered. For rhythmic groups, we use the CRF trainedternary rhythm (TR) with caesuras, and split the sequences at caesuras. Consequently, a line’0201:020’ yields the features ’0201’ and ’020’.First, we tried to classify 100k sentences from poetry and prose (literature) respectively.We extracted the sentences from DTA. For POS n-grams, using unigrams or trigrams did notbeat the random 50% baseline. Training the classifier on bigrams achieves 67% F1. Classifyingsentences based on rhythmic groups performed at 56%, marginally better than the randombaseline.However, when we trained with POS bigrams on whole documents, F1 is around 93%,possibly because this classification relies on rare bigrams, such that sentence structure isoften the same in poetry and prose, but when it differs, it differs strongly.See Table 5 for an overview of feature weights from this latter classification. Higher standingfeatures are more important.2.4 Versemeter vs. EnjambementOur setup also allows us to get an impression of the interaction of enjambement with versemeasures and also POS transitions between lines. Enjambement is an integral part of manypoetic lines. It typically signifies incomplete syntax at the end of a line, such that the end ofthe line encourages a pause in speech, but the sentence, or clause, or phrase, or word is notyet finished.We use the simplest form to operationalize enjambement, by assigning enj+ to lines thatdo not end on a punctuation mark, and enj- to lines that do. Beyond obvious cases (ART_NNdoes not cross clause boundaries), we could not identify clear preferences of enjambement forparticular POS transistions.We implement a set of regular expressions to detect the breadth of verse measures based onthe syllable prediction of the meter CRF. Unsurprisingly, we find that lines with fewer stressed syllables prefer enjambement. However, for measures with six stressed syllables (notation: I:stressed, o:unstressed, ?:previous syllable optional, $:end of line), the runningmeasure hexameter (Ioo?Ioo?Ioo?Ioo?IooIo$) prefers the enjambement with a probability ofp(enj+) = .41, while the alexandrine (oIoIoIoIoIoIo?$) dislikes it with p(enj+) = .16.3 Conclusion & Future Work We have shown experiments on the intersection of syntax and speech rhythm, outlining stresshierarchies with and without context, questioning previous research. Also, we have shownthat a classification of documents on POS bigrams shows clear distinctive features of poetry vs.prose, while classifying sentences is challenging. In the end, we also discussed first explorations regarding enjambement and its interaction with syntax and different verse forms.",thomas.haider@ae.mpg.de,Long Presentation

We offer two network plots that reveal details about the history of musicology, of (a) musicologists that have a lexicon entry each, and (b) the composers that are mentioned in these entries.1 IntroductionOver the 18th and 19th century the academic discipline of musicology had become a central stage for negotiating the value of certain music and aesthetics. These negotiations have also led to the exclusion and deprecation of particular cultural elements, be they issues, music, or people. This discourse has been reflected in the encyclopedia ‘Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart’ (Music in History and Present, MGG, comparable to the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians). It contains 1282 biographical entries of musicologists, representing the Germany centered Western European discourse on musicological knowledge of the last 120 years.To analyze this text corpus at scale, we train named entity (NE) taggers based on BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) with the deepset.ai toolkit. To evaluate our NE taggers, we manually annotate texts from the encyclopedia.Previous manual annotations showed that we might expect data that enables us to analyse the professional network of musicologists exposed in the MGG Online (van Dyck-Hemming and Wald-Fuhrmann, 2019).This approach gives us an overview of socialgroupings, main actors and most negotiated composers (vanDyck-Hemming and Wald-Fuhrmann, 2016), (Latour, 2014). We offer two graphs. In Figure 2 we showthe network of musicologists with encylopedia entries, and in Figure 3 these musicologists with composersmentioned in the entries. If a certain node is not shown (like composers in Figure 2), then it is reduced toan edge. We calculate the importance of a certain actors by eigenvector centrality.2 Named EntitiesWe tune pre-trained BERT models (Devlin et al., 2018) with a sequence classification layer on theCoNLL-2003 Named Entity Dataset (Sang and De Meulder, 2003) and achieve a competitive .85 F1-score. See table 1 for an overview of the F1-scores of our BERT tagger, on conll03 itself and then tested on manual annotation of students.The students annotated around 3000 tokens with the classes Person (PER), Geopolitical Entity (GPE/LOC), Organizations (ORG), other (OTH), temporal expressions (TIME) and professional field, or discipline (FACH). We calculated Cohen kappabetween the annotators on document level. Over all classes, agreement ranges between .5 and .8. Whenremoving FACH, the agreement increases to .7 to .95, suggesting that future research should implementproper guidelines for this label.Our best model achieves a F1-score of 85% on conll03 itself, but on the manual annotation (withTIME, FACH, OTH removed), it only achieves 47% F1-macro.Especially ORG is not reliably detected. Precision figures are also somewhat low, much to our surprise,as manual inspection of the automatically annotated data showed exceptionally good precision.We therefore suspect that (a) the manual annotation (of spans) needs some improvement by better tailoring the guidelines to the used model, and (b) paying special attention to punctuation marks (commas, brackets) that are ubiquitous in encyclopedic articles. Since manual inspection revealed good performance of the model, we use it to extract entities for subsequent processing steps.2.2 Name StandardizationWe automatically removed first names and thus only used surnames. See Figure 1 for an overview ofthe cleaning pipeline. Unfortunately, only relying on last names leads to the conflation of some names, e.g., Hermann and Amalie Abert, the latter being the first female academic musicologist in Germany.2.3 Social Network ExtractionTo obtain a social network, we connect all names that occur with each other in a particular encyclopediaarticle. The network visualization was performed with the software Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009). Wefocused on the Largest Connected Component (Newman, 2010) and discarded nodes with a degree lessthan three. The Modularity (Blondel et al., 2008) measure was used to color-encode modules withinthe network, while the Eigenvector Centrality (Newman, 2010) embraced nodes of higher importance byincreasing their node size. Finally we applied the OpenOrd (Martin et al., 2011) or ForceAtlas2 (Jacomyet al., 2014) layout algorithm to draw the final graphics. In addition to a layout, those algorithms producea visual clustering that give further insights.3 Social networks of influential actors and geographical groupingFigure 2 illustrates a graph of musicologists that are connected by the entities that occur in theirbiography, using only names that occur in the title of an encyclopedic article. We find a central groupof researchers that minted German musicology. This group spans from Hermann and Amalie Abert overArnold Schering, to Hugo Riemann and Heinrich Kretzschmar. The likewise important Erich Hornbosteland Curt Sachs represent the field of systematic musicology, other researchers sharing their interests aregrouped around them. Guido Adler, who is loosely connected to many names, likely because he foundedthe first institute of musicology in Vienna, drifted off center to house his students that are also connectedto the center.We even could partly validate a study based on quantified historical data on Carl Dahlhaus and HansHeinrich Eggebrecht who represent the two main figures of German musicology from 1965 to 1995. Weobserve a clear distinction between both researchers and are able to identify a significantly bigger groupconnected to the younger Dahlhaus.3.1 Musicology and its issueIn additon to the musicologists, the data basis of Figure 3 also includes all names of composers. Here, the visualization shows a network of musicology and its main issues. Composers from the Bach-family or Mozart are the issuesof musicology as an academic discipline. So, the overwhelming dominance of names like ‘Mozart’,‘Bach’, ‘Beethoven’ and ‘Wagner’ represent the dominance of theresearch that musicologists have done on these composers and their music. Especially Bach resp. theBach-family seems to be the one issue deeply connected to the earliest and most important musicologistsnamely Johann Forkel, Philip Spitta, and Guido Adler. Moreover, there are numerous edges (identifiable via colour) linking this group with younger musicologists like Arnold Schering, Hermann Abert, Friedrich Blume and others who shaped musicology of the 1920s.4 ConclusionWe presented a preliminary study of a clearly defined corpus of prosopographical texts, from which we extracted Named Entities and linked these to visualize the social network of musicologists and their relations to certain issues: the composers. This approach is useful for historical research to confirm hypothesis that were draw from arduous manual work. Regarding musicology, we could confirm quantitatively what we expected and already knew from conventional historical research. The overwhelming dominance of a few composers also allows us to reflect about the knowledge standards that musicology has so far relied upon.","thomas.haider@ae.mpg.de, annette.van-dyck-hemming@ae.mpg.de",Poster

This tool is currently under development and will be finalized and available in time for the DH2020 conference. It will enable digital scholars as well as the wider research infrastructure community to quickly and easily obtain a standardized consent form that is conforming to the obligations and regulations of the European Union General Data Protection regulation (GDPR) and therefore legally valid in all of the European Union. Depending on the context for which consent is obtained (e.g. use of images of people at academic events, processing of information shared in surveys, collection / processing of personal data), the wizard users will receive a consent form tailored to their specific needs after answering a series of questions. The different scenarios are the result of discussions with participants of the DH2019 in Utrecht and the DARIAH Annual Meeting 2019 in Warsaw and hence driven by the needs of the research community. Additional meetings with stakeholders from cultural heritage organisations (e.g. ICARUS) and the DARIAH-EU community will ensure a critical evaluation as well as a pragmatic, user-friendly implementation of the tool.It will be inspired by the code of the CLARIN LINDAT Public License Selector (cf. Kamocki et al. 2016) which offers the same service for license selection that we would like to develop for obtaining a consent form. Software developers, legal experts and (digital) humanities researchers will cooperate in the development of this tool, which - while legally addressing the strict data protection regulations of the European Union - will also be of use for the international research community outside Europe, since the consent forms will provide a best-practice template for ethical research conduct when processing personal data, and hence address the increasingly prominent topic of ethical research practice and scientific behaviour, especially in a largely digital, Internet-based research context (cf. Markham & Buchanan 2012, McKee & Porter 2009).The presentation of the poster at the DH2020 conference will allow us to present the wizard to colleagues outside our European network, discuss their needs and experiences with the protection of personal data and hence, if appropriate, adapt the wizard to reflect a global rather than European common perspective on research ethics and the processing of personal data.","vanessa.hannesschlaeger@oeaw.ac.at, koraljka@ief.hr, walter.scholger@uni-graz.at",Poster

Berlin declaration). The Open Science paradigm however is not only restricted to facilitating democratic access to knowledge but also accommodates a set of key values of present-day knowledge creation such as fairness, transparency, equality and increased rigour and accountability in scholarly activities. Open Science therefore involves a cultural shift in the science ecosystem where research workflows are made transparent and subject to greater scrutiny from the early stages of protocols and planning through publication and data sharing. However, copyright laws and other legal frameworks often hinder or even prevent the Opening Up of research (be it research in progress, research data and tools, or research outputs and results).In this forum, we would like to discuss the open sharing and making available of research and knowledge in general, and the global legal restrictions and privileges around copyright and licensing in the context of Open Digital Humanities and, specifically, DH cooperation with cultural heritage institutions on a global scale. Legal experts with in-depth knowledge of various copyright and indigenous knowledge protection systems across the globe will share their perspectives on the similarities and differences between legal systems that facilitate or hinder the Opening Up of humanities data. As these data are often provided (or protected) by cultural heritage institutions, their perspectives as stakeholders in this realm will be considered with special attention. Thus, not only copyright issues will be discussed, but also adjacent areas of the law that are relevant to the possible degree of Openness of humanities research, such as archival laws, personal data protection, and others. In addition, a special focus will be put on the protection of indigenous knowledge, on the question of how it is practiced and preserved by the communities, and the strategies that can be employed to support researchers on the one hand, and protect the interests of the affected communities on the other. The forum is intended to be an open “fishbowl”. The forum facilitators will each provide a short input of max. 3 minutes, briefly introducing themselves and naming the legal system they are experts in (Canada, Europe, India, South Africa and the USA, respectively) and one key area of expertise (e.g. indigenous knowledge protection, open licensing, cultural heritage data). Subsequently, the audience will be invited to propose topics for discussion and pose questions. All participants will be encouraged to contribute to the discussion, and the experts will answer concrete legal questions that come up. A moderator will ensure the balance of expert / participant contributions and the productivity of the discussion.

For this reason, the Austrian Centre for Digital Humanities of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ACDH) started an experiment at the beginning of 2019: For the first time ever, we published the calls for participation in three virtual hackathons funded by the Austrian manifestations of DARIAH and CLARIN, CLARIAH-AT. These hackathons focused on Open Data sets that are publicly available online, and the tasks to perform on these data involved the creation of Open Source code. Each of the hackathons had a special theme and was co-timed with an event that involved an aspect of Openness. These events also inspired the choice of the respective data sets.Usually hackathons take place on site, participants are given tasks to be solved within a given timeframe in a fixed location. This requires the programmers to be flexible and available and to have access to travel funding. A virtual hackathon on the other hand offers people all over the globe the possibility to participate and contribute without having to travel. Therefore, our approach enabled a much larger community to participate in the event on the one hand, thus also promoting the benefits of Open Data on the other.The first hackathon was carried out in cooperation with the European Lexicographical Infrastructure (ELEXIS) and focused on lexicographical data (the Digital Dictionary of Tunis Arabic). The task was to develop a creative mode of processing it, e.g. by enriching it, visualizing it, doing statistical analysis, or integrating it with other resources (e.g. LOD). The submissions were to be handed in by the end of the first ELEXIS observer event taking place in February 2019.For the second hackathon, the ACDH cooperated with the City of Vienna and chose a set from the city’s Open Government Data platform to be processed. The task was to be completed on the Open Data Day Vienna 2019 (28 February 2019). The aim was to develop a creative mode of processing cartographical data showing damage to buildings in Vienna during World War II.The third and final hackathon of the series offered a task to be completed on the International Open Data Day 2019 (2 March 2019). For this final highlight, a choice of two Open Data sets was offered to the participants. The first data set to be worked on in this task was a collection of XML/TEI transcriptions of early German travel guides. The second data set consisted of German historical newspapers and was provided in cooperation with the Europeana newspaper project.The best contributions were determined by an international board of judges and received cash prizes. The criteria for judgement were creativity and innovation, accessibility, reusability and reproducibility, as well as elegance. In our presentation, we will share the lessons learned and show how Open Science was the necessary precondition for this project, as well as what inspired its ultimate success. We will make our case by giving insights into the lessons learned in 2019 and sharing how we improved the concept for the second round of the hackathon series in 2020.","vanessa.hannesschlaeger@oeaw.ac.at, tanja.wissik@oeaw.ac.at",Lightning

However, long-term sustainability and preservation of living systems, in contrast to long-term archiving (LTA) of research data, is still a non-trivial, often institutionally segmented enterprise (Smithies et al., 2019). To counter this, the SustainLife project, running at the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS, University of Stuttgart) and the Data Center for the Humanities (DCH, University of Cologne), uses the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard (OASIS, 2013 and 2019), and the open source ecosystem OpenTOSCA (Breitenbücher et al. 2016). To realize our vision of a sustainable long-term DH research software archive, we are building a repository of software components modeled in TOSCA, i.e., Node Types, and use them to create application blueprints, i.e., Topology Templates in TOSCA, describing the structure of an application.To identify the most used software component types within the DH, we approach the vast field of DH research software from multiple perspectives (Neuefeind et al., 2018 and 2019): (1) We investigate multiple use cases in depth and extract the components used in the respective applications, starting from the operating system (OS) level up to the user interface (UI) layer. These components are then modelled as reusable Node Types in TOSCA which can be utilized to describe the respective application in a TOSCA Topology Template. (2) Qualitative case studies aim at extracting all employed components and technologies of selected applications and (3) quantitative surveys, targeted at DH research software experts (i.e. researchers), are performed to collect community practices and demands. The results from both the case studies and the surveys are then used to identify key components and derive application stacks, i.e., Node Types and Topology Templates.Our poster presents a “Categorisation of Research Software in the Digital Humanities” to spawn discourse about the perspectives of DH research software in contrast to research data (Sahle and Kronenwett, 2013) and how this vast landscape can be indexed in a way that researchers may find the most appropriate set of component types or a suitable application blueprint, when searching for their own software. In this context, we investigate the use of categorial keywords which, in combination with technological identifiers, e.g., programming languages and database types, can be used to provide a means for categorizing research software in the DH. Therefore, our poster will present selected DH research software as a basis for discussion. Hereby, we introduce component types and application stacks from our repository, e.g., an Apache web server or the application stack of a DH research software respectively. Moreover, a set of technological identifiers and categorial keywords, such as digital editions, virtual research environments, and interactive visualisations (Wuttke et al., 2016), associated with these projects will be presented.

Due to the heterogeneity of methods in the Humanities, RDM in the Humanities is very complex. Several data centers and contact points have been established to handle this complexity, support researchers and conduct active RDM. Nevertheless, there are few best practices and policies on how RDM is done in a sustainable and goal-oriented way. In this paper I present a consultation-protocol-template we developed at the Data Center for the Humanities (DCH) at the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Cologne (UoC) to structure and measure RDM in a comprehensive way. I illustrate generic RDM-consultation-workflows developed on the basis of our consultations.1.   Introduction and Background Research data is an essential ingredient and facilitator of scientific progress across all disciplines and includes heterogenous data (Bryant, Lavoie, Malpas, 2017). The developments of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and OpenAIRE, and the plans to establish a national research data infrastructure (NFDI) for the whole German research landscape (RfII, 2016) illustrate that the relevance of RDM has reached a high political level, nationally and internationally.1 However, this is a rather new development and practical implementation has not yet reached maturity.The Data Center for the Humanities (DCH) is the first contact point for researchers in the Humanities at the University of Cologne (UoC) on questions concerning we (Blumtritt, Helling, Mathiak et. al., 2018).2 Through open consultation hours the DCH advise researchers at the Faculty and beyond, attend to their projects and support them as far as RDM is concerned. In addition, we run the Language Archive Cologne (LAC), a repository for audio-visual data, we do active data management and curate, archive and publish research data.4In this paper, I seek to further the professionalization of RDM, by looking closer at the consultation process and the experiences made with it at our institution in 6 years of consultation practice.2.   RDM consultation protocols In order to identify goal-oriented solutions for RDM-needs and as a basis for active RDM, we developed a consultation-workflow (see Figure 1). Through semi-structured interviews and structured consulting protocols, we are offering sustainable RDM-services and -solutions (Helling, Blumtritt and Mathiak, 2018). With more than 70 consulting protocols, the DCH has a wealth of knowledge.Figure 1: The core consulting-workflow at the DCH.On the basis of a comparative analysis of the structured consulting protocols, I was able to identify the core information required for active RDM. The information can be subsumed under the categories (red) context information of a process, (yellow) RDM request-categories with a concrete description of the categories in the context of a consultation and (green) recommendations (see Figure 2).Figure 2: anonymous example of the consulting protocol template: (A) consists of meta information about a process, (B) and (C) are both consulting protocols of a process.3.   Modelling of RDM-consultation workflowsIn 2019, I identified 28 demand-categories in 36 consultations. I started modelling generic workflows for each demand-category fitting with every consultation, where the demand was given with the help of the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).4 I will only illustrate on two examples in this abstract, but plan to show more in the presentation.3.1.   Support with a proposalMany funding institutions ask for statements on how researchers will deal with the digital research data representing the output of an applied project. If a consultation is needed in such a case, we conduct an interview with the researchers and try to receive as much information as possible about the project, which we translate into our consultation-protocol-template.Figure 3: Consultation workflow for support with a proposal.Based on the information in the protocol, we then follow the steps as detailed in Fig. 3, always taking the context information into account. Based on similar cases, we suggest a text to describe possible strategies for data management and define fundamental steps of data handling, archiving and publishing.These formulations get integrated into the overall application by the researchers and thus become part of the proposal.3.2.   Data archivingAnother common request is the archiving (see Figure 4) of data at the end of a project. After the generic steps of a workflow described already, we start to search for a fitting repository with respect to the conditions of the actual data and the whole project.Figure 4: Consultation workflow for data archiving.We developed a system of priorities that we work through step by step: at first, we check if we can identify a (1) domain-specific repository that fits with the given needs and conditions. In our case, this can be the LAC, or an external repository. If there is no solution, we check if there is a fitting (2) generic repository. In our case, this can only be an external repository, but, in the context of another data center, it could be a generic repository driven by the data center.In any case the results of the investigation need to be passed to the researchers: either we mediate a contact to an external repository, or we present information about the conditions of archiving data in the LAC.Conclusion The formal description of our workflows optimizes both consultations and active RDM. The workflows follow acknowledged standards as well as know-how and experiences made by data managers since 2013. Thanks to these procedures, we are able to deal with the diversity of RDM-requirements in the Humanities in an effective and standardized way and we can handle different consultations with the same or a similar request equally. This makes RDM measurable and comprehensible. Because of the abstract level of modelling, the workflows are generic and can be adapted in different contexts.In my talk, I will present more workflow models and in a more detailed way. Contextually, I will define RDM-requirements and -services based on active data management in a comprehensive way and show synergies between different needs and service structures. This will lead me to a plea for the necessity of measurable RDM-structures based on RDM done in expert centers by data manager, as opposed to the common approach of building and establishing contact points and training a mediating data manager based on recommendations of political and scientific committees and umbrella organizations that are not closely related to daily research and RDM.",patrick.helling@uni-koeln.de,Short Presentation

Following Marie Hicks, Safiya Noble, Jacque Wernimont, and Marisa Parham, my working argument is that the embroidered canvases reveal that statistical natural language processing (traditionally associated with masculinized rationality) can be reframed as an explicitly feminist incursion into the larger digital humanities landscape.I am interested in feedback from scholars and practitioners who work across multiple media forms, especially those with experience or interest in transitioning from traditional monographs toward more embodied and haptic forms of scholarship.",ahenrichs@amherst.edu,Lightning

Though this is changing, the pace is slow, and most DH pedagogy remains targeted at graduate students and faculty at R1 universities. Bryan Alexander and Rebecca Frost Davis have identified several reasons for the lack of DH pedagogy at small liberal arts colleges (SLACs), including “logistics, infrastructure, and campus identity.” Briefly, SLACs frequently do not have either the critical mass or the funding to make DH courses (which can be resource-intensive for both individual faculty and the broader institution) viable. Additionally, SLACs emphasize a liberal undergraduate education, which can be skeptical of or even hostile to training students in the concrete technical skills that digital humanists frequently need to build digital projects. Nearly a decade after Alexander and Davis identified the particular challenges for DH instruction in a SLAC context, SLACs are shifting towards developing DH minors, certificates, and sometimes even majors in their curricula. Yet many of the challenges—of logistics and campus identity in particular—remain the same. In other words, small colleges can feel insular and insulated from larger digital humanities contexts.This poster presents a case study of what one response to these challenges can be: to teach students not only how to apply skills like HTML in a particular course context, but also to frame DH and DH pedagogy as always aimed toward a wider audience. The course which serves as the case study for the poster, to be taught in Spring 2020 at Amherst College, is titled “Books and Their Afterlives: Text as Technology.” Students both examine and use a wide variety of textual technologies from across the centuries: they handle rare books in a college archive, write HTML to develop a narrative in Twine, and experiment with 3D printing pens and paper circuits in order to investigate text as a concept, a technology, and a material artefact.This poster serves two functions: first, it will enact practical DH pedagogy by engaging students in developing the poster, encouraging them to think of their course work as public facing. Second, the poster will demonstrate the arc of the course to that public audience. It will include the guiding principles of the course’s design: the remaining poster content will be determined by student collaborators.This poster will be of interest to faculty and instructional staff in environments that might resist DH pedagogy, such as small liberal arts colleges and libraries. It will also be of interest to those in environments that have embraced DH pedagogy who might want an example of engaging students in active learning through public-facing digital work.",ahenrichs@amherst.edu,Poster

Print culture offers rich opportunities for digitization, and I engage with current conversations in Victorian studies about developing sustainable, scholar-driven digital resources produced outside of commercial ventures like GALE and ProQuest (Stauffer; Fyfe). For example, Felluga argues for resisting skeuomorphic forms of knowledge production by capitalizing on new technologies (44), while Wisnicki points to the success of nineteenth-century digital archives which emphasize materiality, are user-friendly, and are sustainable with little funding (984). I engage with work on the potential of digitization as a means of navigating and preserving Victorian print media (Mussell), on canonical scholarship of hypermedia and digital textualities (Landow; Bolter; Gaggi; McGann; Hayles), and on recent work on the hypermedia reading and cognitive hypertext comprehension (Ryan; Shang; Medina-Medina et al.) to examine how interactive media offers a model of digitally representing Victorian print culture which resists the form of the printed book. The theoretical framing of this project addresses the following questions: 1) What potential is there for interactive hypertext to represent the materiality, dissemination, and readerships of serialized print texts? 2) How do Victorian texts speak to the concerns of digital publishing and materiality in a public digital humanities context?As a seminal text in the history of urban poverty, London Labour has been subject to continuous remediation and repurposing. It was attributed to Henry Mayhew, but was the collaborative product of multiple actors, including multiple journalists, editors, publishers, readers, and the London poor themselves. The multimodal remediation of pieces of this collaborative work as a newspaper column, independent serial, expensive volume set, stage play, reading series, 'unfashionable' novel, and twenty-first century selected print editions, destabilizes readings of London Labour as an authoritative encyclopedic resource of nineteenth-century culture and poverty. Its volume and irregular production history make it difficult to engage with (Roddy et al. 482; Schroeder), a common problem when studying periodicals (Robson). In its current digitized forms on Google Books and Internet Archive, London Labour is represented using facsimile scans of its four volumes, which, despite being comprehensive and searchable, are not subject to bibliographic control, and feature unreliable OCR. However, London Labour invites a nonlinear and interconnected model of reading that speaks to, and even anticipates, hypertextual forms of reading. My project features twenty-five of Mayhew’s articles, selected according to two pressing themes: first, waste collection and recycling, and second, the publication history and the materiality of books in London Labour. These selections contain scholarly annotations and are hyperlinked in connecting pathways. They can be read chronologically, or by selecting keywords and thematic clusters. The selections also compare plain-text transcripts to nineteenth-century facsimiles, emphasizing the text’s uneven production. Drawing from Scanlan’s reading of the poor as producers circulating in an alternative waste economy, and Price’s work on the material cycles of paper and books in Mayhew’s work, my project interrogates the following carrefours: first, the intersections between Mayhew and the street-folk in the urban space of Victorian London represented in London Labour; and, more broadly, the intersection between Victorian print and the digital humanities. Receiving feedback will position me to expand this open-access resource as a collaborative project, and to develop its pedagogical potential for training students in digital methods and tools through the lens of print studies.",jenna.herdman@carleton.ca,Poster

INAC 2019), in Canada, the Atikamekw First Nation has the highest percentage of people who speak their native language (Atikamekw) at home. The Atikamekw live in Quebec, Canada, and have a population of 8,000 people in three communities.In 2013, Nastasia Herold, one of the authors of this paper did a field study in Manawan, one of the three Atikamekw communities, for a research on the local bilingualism (Atikamekw and French). Despite the vitality of the Atikamekw language, a survey and interviews showed that francization and language change are processes noticed by all living generations of the Atikamekw (cf. Herold 2020: N.N.).Communication takes place more and more often digitally (cf. Reichert 2017: 26-27), and this in written language rather than orally. Atikamekw has a standardized orthography since 1994 (cf. Dinnison 21997) and is taught in Manawan’s primary school as a first language and as medium of alphabetization. However, Herold’s (2019: 103) research in 2013 showed that the Internet contained no written text in the Atikamekw language, the Atikamekw used the Internet mainly in French. This is why a school project at Manawan’s secondary school was initiated in 2013 in order to create a Wikipedia site in the Atikamekw language.Many lessons have been learned during the collaboration of academics, teachers, pupils, local language experts and other local voluntary contributors. The lessons we would like to focus on in this presentation are the lessons learned when implementing cultural knowledge to an open access platform. Open access is the free provision of (scientific) texts on the web without restriction of use (cf. Kohle 2017: 203), and this free provision has advantages and disadvantages.We will give four examples which show that the Atikamekw made sure that the knowledge was published respecting their own principles, beliefs and tradition. These four examples and the development of the project show how it is important that the community itself dictates rules that have to be respected when publishing their knowledge under open access.Finally we will answer Rehbein’s and Thies’ (2017: 355) question they developed as a schema for questions of responsibilities and ethics of a specific project: Who (1) is responsible for what (2) to whom (3) before which instance (4) according to which standards (5)?","nastasia.herold@uni-leipzig.de, thereseottawa@gmail.com",Short Presentation

Introducing ELTeC for Multilingual and Pluricultural Distant ReadingThis contribution reports on the collaborative effort of building an open access multilingual corpus of European novels published 1840-1920 (the European Literary Text Collection - ELTeC) within the COST Action “Distant Reading”.[1]Working at the intersection of many languages and cultures, we address practical and technical aspects of corpus design based on a theoretical discussion of pluri-cultural computational modeling of literature. In the corpus design, we adopt a metadata-based approach that allows for representing the diversity of novels published 1840-1920 across Europe. Our sampling and balancing criteria use metadata including publication date, text length, reprint counts and authors’ gender,[2] and we deliberately focus on inclusion of non-canonical novels.We have built a workflow for systematically sampling and encoding novels as well as a consistent annotation model of data and metadata (cf. Burnard, Schöch, Odebrecht, 2019). Currently, ELTeC constitutes a dynamic intersection of fictional discourse in fourteen languages, including Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Serbian, Slovenian, and Spanish (ca. 600 text candidates amounting to ca. 52 mio. words).[3] Figure 1 depicts the current state of the Portuguese sample, across categories “text length” (long, medium, short), “gender” (female, male), and “date slot” (T1-4; https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/por/index.html).Figure 1. Screenshot of Portuguese sampleOur TEI-XML (TEI Consortium, 2019) encoding scheme aims is minimal, but aims at facilitating a rich and well-informed distant reading. ELTeC is rooted in the open data movement, with collaborative data creation and an open access extensive documentation for (meta-)data schema, decisions and workflows.[4] Each version of ELTeC is archived via Zenodo.[5] Thus, our (meta)data are re-usable, interoperable, accessible and findable (cf. FAIR Guiding Principles; Wilkinson et al., 2016).In view of the problematic notion of “representativeness” (see Biber, 1993), ELTeC deliberately refrains from modeling the statistical distribution of populations of publication or reception (cf. Herrmann & Lauer, 2019). Rather, we address the inevitable bias included in the sampling (see Bode, 2018), as well as the explicit link to research questions (Underwood, 2019; Lüdeling, 2011) and the act of construction (Piper, 2019).ELTeC caters to the computational modeling of literature at the intersection of cultures, nations, languages, genders, but also poetologies, trends, and traditions, in a historical period of extreme aesthetic change and diversity. Giving one example, in collaboration with other working groups, using demonym and named entity recognition, it is possible to comparatively explore images of ‘the other’ (ethnic, national, regional; Leerssen, 2016). Generally, in the creation of ELTeC we aim at inductively defining what a ‘novel’ is, allowing for diverse approaches in literary theory and history to be explored and tested.The research described in this paper was conducted in the context of the COST Action ""Distant Reading for European Literary History"" (CA16204 - ""Distant-Reading"").

At the intersection of literary studies, corpus stylistics, and digital humanities, we present an exploratory quantitative metaphor analysis of a corpus of German language lay book reviews. Using a deliberately simple methodological approach that operates on seed words for conceptual sources and targets we investigate how reading experiences of literary texts are metaphorically presented by reviewers.We explore a corpus of approx. 1.3 mill. book reviews for metaphors used to conceptualize the target domain READING EXPERIENCE.In line with conceptual metaphor theory, metaphors in language are understood as closely linked to human thought processes and experiences (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, pp. 4–6; Shutova, 2017). They are mappings from typically more basic experiential source domains (LIFE) to more abstract target domains (READING EXPERIENCE), indicated by indirectly used lexis (the words come, end, and road in “we've come to the end of our road”, VUAMC, Steen et al., 2010).Starting from findings on literature reviews in English (Stockwell, 2009; Nuttall & Harrison, 2018) and on reviews in German (Köhler, 1999), we analyze metaphor patterns in social reading networks, with a particular focus on the mapping READING EXPERIENCE IS MOTION. The main aim at this stage is to draw up a first typology of mappings.Method and DataMetaphor IdentificationIn view of the challenges of reliable automatic metaphor detection (Veale et al., 2016), we apply a deliberately simple rule-based corpus stylistic approach (Deignan & Semino, 2010). A commonly used resource for identification of metaphorical lexical items per source domain is semi-automatic semantic tagging (Demmen et al., 2015). However, in the absence of an out-of-the-box semantic tagger for German, we rely on a ‘traditional’ onomasiological resource (Dornseiff, 2004). Metaphors are identified by (1) detecting seed words for target domains, (2a-c) detecting source domain seed words in the textual neighborhood of target domain seed words: the metaphor vehicles. Potential metaphors are examined and assigned to a typology of mappings by inspection of KWICs (3).Step 1. To identify target domain seed words, we compile a list of ‘objects of reading experience’ (OREs), i.e. noun lemmas that refer to aspects of reading (literary works, such as Buch ‘book’, Geschichte ‘story’, Roman ‘novel’ and parts thereof, such as Ende ‘ending’ or Spannung ‘suspense’, see Table 1).Step 2. (2a) Potential source domains are pre-identified by manual MIPVU annotation of small samples of the data (cf. Herrmann et al., in press), and the literature on ‘reading’ metaphors (e.g. Nuttall & Harrison, 2018). For the present paper, we focus on conceptualizations of reading experiences as MOTION (see Herrmann & Messerli, submitted, for metaphor vehicles from the domain FOOD INTAKE). (2b) The lexical access points to the MOTION domain are provided by a word list extracted from Dornseiff (2004) for the semantic field Fortbewegung (8.3, see Table 2). (2c) To find potential metaphor vehicles that refer to ORE (and not to some other referent), cooccurrences are computed between ‘motion’ lemmas and ORE, with a window of 10 lemmas around ORE (using raw frequencies, see Table 3).[1][Table 1: Objects of Reading Experience (ORE) in LoBo][Table 2: Ten most frequent potential MOTION seed words in LoBo][Table 3: Cooccurrences. Most frequent MOTION seed words within a window of ten words of an ORE]Step 3. From the resulting frequency list of potential ‘motion’-metaphor vehicles (n= 389,689) a sub-section of the most common lemmas is examined by means of KWICs to determine whether potential vehicles were indeed used metaphorically. In a qualitative step, we infer usage patterns from the resulting true metaphor positives (Table 4).DataThe LoBo corpus (extracted from the social reading platform “Lovelybooks”) contains approx. 1.3 mill. German language reviews by 54,000 users, amounting to 439,923,000 words (Table 4), spread over 15 genres. Each review features a rating (1–5 stars) that refers to a specific book. The corpus is lemmatized and PoS-tagged with TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), and encoded in CWB (http://cwb.sourceforge.net/).[Table 4: Overview of word frequencies of ORE and source domain seed words in LoBo]AnalysisA first result is a list of those lemmas from the semantic field Fortbewegung ‘motion’ that occur frequently within a window of ten words of ORE. While it does not yet allow for conclusive results regarding metaphor use, this list serves as an intermediary step towards identifying a multitude of MOTION metaphors for subsequent analysis establishing a typology of mapping patterns.The analysis of KWICs shows that certain manners of motion are particularly frequent. Notable are the motions of walking, flying, and driving/riding, realized with the lemmas gehen ‘to go’, fliegen ‘to fly’, and Fahrt ‘ride/drive’. Notable is variance of ‘speed’, with fast motion (Fahrt, fliegen), and slower motion (gehen).Another important observation is about agency within the metaphorical scenario. Readers position themselves mainly as (a) observers who see how the plot moves along; (b) agents who actively ‘walk’ and ‘fly’ through the story (or a book’s pages); (c) patients being put in motion by the book; and (d) companions who travel along with an ORE (see Table 5). Findings demonstrate the complexity of reading that cannot be restricted to passive reception or hedonistic consumption (cf. Rebora et al., 2019).[Table 5: Categories of mappings READING IS MOTION in LoBo]In all, our study offers a first typology of metaphorical MOTION-mappings in digital shared reading, as well as evidence of the productivity of MOTION as a source domain for READING in German lay reviews (cf. Nuttall & Harrison, 2019, for English reviews). Extending this exploratory phase into statistical analysis, we plan variance analysis with factors as reader’s evaluation (star ratings) and book genre (e.g., middle brow vs. popular). Methodologically, we plan to improve precision of metaphor detection, e.g. by including semantic information from resources such as GermaNet, but also through active learning.

Our papers showcase a range of projects and vantage points aimed at giving visibility to Latinx lived experience, while taking steps to radically unmake/remake archival practices and memory work in a way that is accountable to and in participation with Latinx communities. Our projects are grounded in justice and community-oriented work spanning disparate academic and artistic fields, including photography, critical curatorial and archival praxis, visual studies, and digital humanities. We ask and then demonstrate: What might be alternative means for recovering hidden stories of the Latinx diaspora? How do we practice memory work in a way that is accountable to and in participation with its subjects? What might be new methods for archival and curatorial work that are in accordance with the lived realities of the communities we are working with? We invite discussion to help further develop community-centered initiatives and hope that audience members will leave with new ideas for community-engaged and justice-based work.Paper Abstracts:Marisa Hicks-Alcaraz, PhD Student in Cultural Studies at Claremont Graduate University and co-founder of ImaginX en Movimiento""ImaginX en Movimiento: Building a Rasquache Digital Archive""ImaginX en Movimiento (IXeM) is a Los Angeles-based moving image archive and collective I co-founded (with one foot in and one foot out of academia) in May 2019 in effort to counter exclusionary practices that prevent community access and participation in cultural memory work. This paper is an ethnographic case study that provides critical reflections on the strategies employed by IXeM that respond to particular constraints and challenges pertaining to labor and cost, including operations, acquisition of equipment, funding, and collaborative initiatives for community engagement. This case study will posit labor and cost solutions against a background of scarce resources as well as forge new ideas for community-engaged and justice-based recuperation methods in academia.In particular, this paper reflects on the way IXeM expresses a rasquache defiance that is situated within digital ethnic studies and the larger movement of community-based archiving, as well as in the interrogation of traditional (Anglo, heteropatriarchal-centric) archival authority. According to Chicanx art historian, Tomás Ybarra-Frausto, being rasquache is the visceral response to lived reality and an attitude rooted in resourcefulness and adaptability (1989). The Chicanx phenomenon of rasquachismo, or the view of the downtrodden, encourages its practitioners to use the materials available at hand to create something that is accessible and belongs to the people. A deliberate choice, rasquachismo is political and subversive; a tool of activism and an anti-elite practice. In this paper, I develop the idea of digital rasquachismo as a way to dismantle traditional archival practices that reinforce oppressive systems that disproportionately subject Brown and Black bodies to generational inequities and inspire alternative methods that retool digital technologies to center the lived experiences and wellbeing of those at the margins.Blurring the divide between choice and necessity, IXeM is driven by both a socioeconomic imperative and a deliberate choice to challenge the authority of top-down knowledge systems by retooling commercial content sharing platforms as archival databases (see: @veteranas_and_rucas, @blvckvrchives, @latinx_diaspora_archives, @quinceaneraarchives, LA Freewaves), which some scholars have viewed as revolting and others an avenue of revolt. Going beyond just “making do,” IXeM enacts a radical politics of resistance by grabbing hold of the tools of social media to transform cultural memory work and its publics; in effect, using the master’s tools to dismantle the master’s house.While we see such platforms as presenting opportunities to transform the practice of social memory, we also firmly acknowledge the ways in which they can be (and have been) used to cause harm and facilitate surveillance and oppression. As such, this talk will consider both the ethical risks and opportunities afforded by these new tools, especially as they pertain to documenting Latinx grief and trauma in the wake of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, its economic fallout, and the current uprisings against racist police brutality.","mhicksalcaraz@gmail.com, william.camargo@cgu.edu, joedvalencia@gmail.com, samanthamariafriend@gmail.com",Panel

In the most prominent model of these periodicals – The Spectator (1711-1712, 1714) – the real authors, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele, create the fictitious author-character of ‘Mr. Spectator’ who, as an anonymous and confidence inspiring observer, communicated with the readers by exchanging letters with them. Yet, not only Addison and Steele but also other collaborators hid behind the eidolon of ‘Mr. Spectator’. However, the real authors tagged the individual issues by a code of letters, which enables the readers of the time and contemporary literary scholars to attribute issues of respective periodicals to a specific author (cf. Rau 1980, 74).Throughout the 18th century, all Spectator emulations adopted the mask of the fictitious author, but largely lacked these authorial markers, making it difficult to attribute them to a specific author with close reading literary analysis methods. To counteract this problem, distant reading methods, such as stylometry, can provide significant insights into the text corpus of the pan-European Spectator press, especially regarding the attribution of presumably anonymous and collaborative authorship.The publicly available digital edition of the European Spectators, implemented at the University of Graz, contains more than 3.500 single issues of periodicals in Spanish (647 issues), French (1672 issues), and Italian (1320 issues) which are encoded using the standard of the Text Encoding Initiative.

In recent years efforts have been undertaken to 3DScan Maraet al. (2010), to paleographically describe Homburg (2019) and to digitally recon-struct broken fragments Collins et al. (2014, 2017) of cuneiform tablets. However,not always broken fragments can complement each other and often parts of thecuneiform tablet remain destroyed. These fractures or gaps in the cuneiformtablet are not always easy for scholars to fill and take a considerable amount ofinterpretation time on their part. With the emergence of more digitally availablecuneiform text resources, this publication sees an opportunity to investigate ifauto-complete algorithms, based on machine learning and linguistic linked opendata (LLOD) resources Homburg (2017) can be useful in the reconstructionof cuneiform texts. The classification results are to be used to create a epochand language specific recommendation system to fill gaps on cuneiform tablets,therefore assisting cuneiform scholars.Related WorkRelated work has been done in autocompletion systems which face the similarchallenge of anticipating the users input derived from context and other featuresLeung & Zhang (2008), Gikandi (2006), Hyvönen & Mäkelä (2006). Those tech-nologies are heavily relied on in input method engines1 which are powered withdifferent dictionary-based algorithms, but recently Chen et al. (2015), Huanget al. (2018) also with machine learning approaches and neural networks. Inputmethod engines for cuneiform have been developed by Homburg et al. (2015).Methodology Following Homburg & Chiarcos (2016) machine learning methods applied areeither based on grammatical rules (POSTagging), dictionary-based methods ex-ploiting (third-party) dictionary resources or statistical approaches using thefollowing types of machine learning features:– Context-dependent features: e.g. for Hidden Markov Model Classifications– Grammatical features derived from POSTaggers– Semantic Features derived from the semantic meaning of surrounding words– Metadata Features e.g. text categorizations– Paleographic Features using PaleoCodage for a subset of manually annotatedtexts Homburg (2019)Experimental SetupThe effectiveness of the algorithms and features is tested on a corpus of all CDLItexts in ATF which is split in a training and test set.

Paleographers, describe how a text has been displayed, andcollect information such as writing styles, contextual information and the epoch.Ciula (2017) gives a good summary about digital paleography and its practices.Challenges concerning digital paleography are discussed by Hassner et al. (2015)for writing systems and discussed more broadly in Stokes (2015). The mainresults of these publications is, that the community of digital paleographers,which was mainly focused on a few particular languages, sees to broaden itsscope and to research more global models to represent paleographic featuressuch as writing style, typographic features and anomalies in texts. This calls fora unified representation of paleographic features to which this publication wouldlike to contribute by suggesting a core vocabulary for paleographic descriptionof texts.Related WorkPaleographic features can to a certain extent be represented in TEI/XML1 Wit-tern et al. (2009) (scribal shifts, scribal alterations) as highlighting annotations.For systematic non-alphabetic languages, encodings can be developed to repre-sent the shape of the characters, e.g. for cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphicsHomburg (2019), van den Berg (1997)In the linguistic community, linguistic linked open data (LLOD)McCrae et al.(2016) is very present and allows for tools such as BabelNet Navigli & Ponzetto(2012), a multilingual semantic network to translate words and texts based onsemantic content. This publication suggests to create such a semantic networkfor paleographic descriptions in order to formalize this part of research. Natu-rally, such a task cannot be done by a single scholar from a single field, so thepublication begins by suggesting vocabulary contents documenting the structureof systematic scripts like cuneiform and to model relations between componentsof parts of scripts, the so-called core vocabulary. Especially structured scripts(cf. fig. 1) expose a variety of encoding schemes for e.g. Chinese Bishop & Cook(2003), Japanese Apel (2014). Those encodings have been created to modelfonts, but form an ideal basis to create the proposed unified vocabulary. Similarto the OliA ontologies Chiarcos & Sukhareva (2015) the author suggests to ex-tend this core vocabulary representing the structure of the script (figure 3) bylanguage/script specific extensions. The concept will be presented using the ex-ample of cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphics and builds upon the vocabularyshown in figure 2. Figure 1. Example of the PaleoCodage encodingHomburg (2019): PaleoCodage repre-sents a machine-readable way to describe highly structured scripts such as cuneiform.This structure, relations to other similar characters and scripts can be modelled usingthe proposed core vocabulary, while the language specific vocabularies would describewriting styles, shapes and stilistic characteristics of the respective script.

This panel brings together different approaches to using network analysis to understand the relationships that rhyme enacts in poetry in different language traditions. As the papers in this panel suggest, as one moves from considering rhyme’s function within a single poem to examining larger datasets, one can also consider how rhyme connects words, documents, and/or authors within a corpus. By juxtaposing papers focusing on poetry in Czech, English, Russian, and Spanish, this panel highlights the fact that rhyme is defined differently in different linguistic and poetic contexts, due to the levels of inflection present in different languages and to the development of different poetic traditions. Some rhyme definitions focus on the shared stressed vowel of single syllables, others encompass polysyllabic rhyme, and others focus on component phonemes, rather than whole words. Thus computational approaches to rhyme must be tailored to the particular languages of the texts under study. The papers on this panel use different network analysis and graph visualization methods to examine rhyme at the level of the corpus or dataset, rather than the individual poem, in order to understand how rhyme practice changes over time, across languages, and in relation to literary canon formation. It thus contributes both to computational poetics and distant reading methodologies within the digital humanities.   Distant Reading Nineteenth-Century British Poetry With Rhyme NetworksNatalie M. HoustonUniversity of Massachusetts Lowell1. IntroductionThe expectations and assumptions that nineteenth-century English readers brought to their reading of poetry was necessarily different from that which readers today bring to the same texts. One feature of that historical difference was their familiarity with poetic rhyme, and the assumptions about poetic language that it created. By examining rhyme words and sounds in a large dataset of English poems, we can better understand how rhyme shaped poetic discourse in the nineteenth century. This paper suggests that network analysis methods are useful for understanding the semantic networks created by the relatively limited set of rhymes available in English; for examining chronological and aesthetic explanations for changes in rhyme practice; and for exploring the relationships between poems that use the same rhyme pairs. Such analyses reveal the semantic and sonic features of conventional nineteenth-century poetry, and can thereby also distinguish unconventional or distinctive uses of rhyme.2. Context The vast majority of English poems published in the nineteenth century were rhymed (95% of the 108,842 poems in the Chadwyck-Healey English Poetry corpus used for this study). Both poets and readers thus expected poetry to be rhymed (McDonald 2012, 7) and many of the rhyme sounds and rhyme words used in nineteenth-century poetry were so frequently used as to create a set of implicit conventions of poetic discourse. Uncovering such implicit conventions can help reveal the structures of the field of poetry at the large scale (Bourdieu 1993). This project identifies rhyme words, groups, and syllables through a method that operationalizes the historical rules for rhyme found in nineteenth-century British rhyme dictionaries, in order to match words according to historical pronunciation and poetics (Houston 2016, 2019). Three different kinds of network analyses are then performed: a rhyme word co-occurrence network, a rhyme pair co-printing network, and a textual coupling network (Houston 2017).4. Rhyme Networks Because rhyme word frequency in British poetry follows a power law distribution, in which a small number of rhyme words are very frequently used, followed by a long tail of additional words, the rhyme word co-occurrence network can reveal the relationship between those frequencies and the clusters of rhyme words that are most likely to occur within the same poem. The rhyme pair co-printing network, based on co-citation analysis, links specific rhyme pairs if they appear in the same poem. Together these two networks reveal the semantic and sonic patterns that structured nineteenth-century poetic discourse. The textual coupling network, based on bibliographic coupling, links two poems if they use the same rhyme pairs. This network reveals chronological and aesthetic subgroups, suggesting how rhyme practice changed through the century. The talk employs network analysis in order to explore to what extent rhyme pairs are shared across works by different authors in nineteenth-century Czech poetry. We show that the degree of recurrence is (1) comparable to Russian poetry, (2) noticeably weaker as compared to German and Spanish poetry and (3) strikingly weaker as compared to English poetry. Following the hypothesis formulated in Plecháč 2018, we offer a linguistic explanation for such findings: the size of rhyme repertory in a given language depends upon its inflection, the changes in word forms used to mark grammatical aspects such as voice, case, tense, mood, number, or gender. Roughly speaking—the more suffixes the language employs, the richer rhyme repertory gets as completely different words may rhyme only due to being followed by the same grammatical endings.As one may expect, we find that in all the languages examined the tendency to share rhyme pairs is stronger between works that come roughly from the same period than between those distant in time. We thus try to represent each work as a vector defined by the relative frequencies of rhyme pairs and use machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) in order to classify them into time periods or poetic movements. Cross-validations of the models show that depending on what classes are being used, the accuracy varies between 0.6 to 0.9 and always outperforms the random baseline.","Natalie_Houston@uml.edu, plechac@ucl.cas.cz, ruizfabo@unistra.fr, helena.bermudezsabel@unil.ch, djbpitt@gmail.com, enthorsen@gmail.com",Panel

In particular, my project explores the growing community of amateur writers who are using Twitter as a means of publication and dissemination for their literary output. There are three parts to my project: the research findings related to the global literary community on Twitter, the tools and resources developed as part of the project and made openly available to other scholars, and partnership with a university library to ensure the long-term preservation of the collected data.The data that I have collected shows that social media is altering literary practices by providing a space for amateur writers to publish, disseminate, and receive feedback from a global community of writers. Preliminary figures put the number of active Anglophone writers using Twitter as a publication platform for their literary output at over 1 million users per year since 2015, and writers working in non-English languages on Twitter raise these numbers even higher. This practice is changing how literature is produced, published, and shared. Readerships too are changing, for rather than being tied to print subscriptions or access to physical books, audiences of social media literature are based on online communities and tied to the costs of physical devices and internet access.My presentation will showcase these research findings in order to highlight the importance and necessity of social media archival work. In so doing, I will discuss how I collected the data using a Python script (co-developed by myself and several other scholars), challenges of cleaning up and visualizing this data (using ArcGIS and tools developed by Documenting the Now), and ethical best-practices for using social media data in research. Information relating to this process – including detailed instructions, the Python scripts used to collect Twitter data, and a list of resources – are free and openly accessible on the project’s website (www.twit-lit.com) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/TwitLit/TwitLitSource). Other scholars are invited to use these scripts and other resources to collect their own social media data.Additionally, my project has attempted to plan for the long-term preservation of the over eight million tweets that I have collected. This preservation has been made difficult by Twitter’s strict Developer Policy and Agreement, which prevents individuals from keeping or disseminating large data sets for more than 30 days. The only exception to this policy is made on behalf of academic institutions, which may store Twitter data for unlimited amounts of time on behalf of academic research. The Project TwitLit project thus presents best-practices for establishing a working relationship with university libraries for storing and disseminating Twitter data in a way that is both in accord with Twitter’s legal restrictions and responsive to the needs of scholars. In short, Project TwitLit provides a case-study of a growing community on Twitter while simultaneously developing a set of tools and guidelines for other scholars seeking to engage in similar work. In December 2017, the Library of Congress, which began archiving Twitter in 2010, announced that it would no longer collect all Tweets; instead, Tweets produced after December 2017 would only be collected on a selective basis. There are no other ongoing, systematic efforts to collect and preserve this digital material. See Library of Congress, “Update on the Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress” (December 2017).

By extracting the natural phenomena in the historical texts, analyzing the environmental possibilities and restrictions, learning on the impact on social phenomena at the time, we gain insight into the causes and effects of social pulsations.

It argues that by adopting formal ontological modelling1, not only can we make scholarly argumentation conducive to long-term preservation and ongoing participation in the scholarly discourse, but also make it the starting point for genuinely collaborative research endeavours. Moreover, by virtue of their ontological foundation, knowledge models ideally represent reproducible interpretative processes.Knowledge modelling has been an ongoing field of research in the digital humanities for many years. Flagship projects such as ResearchSpace2 have helped to popularize the concepts of semantic integration and to make the benefits of this approach tangible for the research community. While there has been acknowledgement of the importance of formalization of scholarly argumentation in both literary studies and digital humanities3, there have been a number of practical and ideological barriers to its realization. The former often relate to the perceived steep learning curve associated with ontologically underpinned knowledge modelling, the latter to a perceived infringement of scholarly expressivity and freedom. This paper addresses both concerns by integrating an easy-to-use modelling tool with a literary corpus, highlighting opportunities for beneficial formalisms, clarity, and precision of expression wherever possible, so users are enabled to collaboratively create and collectively benefit from improved knowledge representations.In the context of the research strand of the Eighteenth-Century Poetry Archive (ECPA) project4, I have developed a Web-based knowledge modelling tool intended to enable literary scholars to model their argumentation about the poems in the database.5 I will demonstrate that as a form of integrated knowledge representation, visualization, and preservation, the knowledge models created can both express and integrate different (including contradictory) argumentative strands.The tool thus encourages intersection of otherwise dispersed and isolated scholarly arguments, the breaking up of intellectual silos, and helps towards dispelling the persistent myth of the lone scholar in the humanities. In the spirit of the conference theme, the paper touches on many aspects of the open data movement that underpin and are prerequisites for this work, such as Open Access, Open Scholarship, and Open Standards (such as LOD, shared ontologies, taxonomies, and vocabularies).Approach and implementationThe ECPA knowledge modelling tool facilitates and encourages the creation of models that focus on different aspects of a poem, yet are all collectively modelling the object of study and all arriving at ever more sophisticated and comprehensive models. It is through formalization using shared conceptualizations, that the models created remain useful beyond the original context and purpose of their creation. They can thus be shared, re-used, adapted (forked), enhanced, aggregated, and even developed collaboratively.The ECPA modelling tool is both a modelling and publishing platform. As such, it offers a number of workflow management options that support the entire modelling process, from inception through to publication. It has been designed in a way that is easy to grasp, learn, and perform. Its layout consists of a number of workflow buttons (e.g. fork, close, save, download, publish) along with the model itself in both its graph representation6 and a control panel, which provides information about the model, a representation of the model's components (classes, instances, and statements) in text form, and an editing tool.Figure 1: Template for a person record pre-filled with Wikidata informationThe editing tool offers three related approaches to the creation of the instances (individuals) and relations that together form a scholarly argument. Firstly, a number of templates are provided for some of the key ontological classes frequently used in modelling (currently, persons, works, objects, events, places, concepts, and argumentation). These templates can be auto-filled from Wikidata representations of the items where available. Secondly, the tool offers a number of shortcuts7, which provide a convenient way of connecting common classes in standardized ways. Shortcuts are currently provided between things, places, actors, events/time, and concepts. Each shortcut takes the form of a path of one or more statements (triples) that follow on from each other. Thirdly, the full expressivity of the ontology is available by using a taxonomy tree display of the classes in the project's ontologies, which provides the most granular modelling option. The best results are often achieved by using the three approaches (templates, shortcuts, and taxonomy) in parallel.Figure 2: Part of a knowledge graph with ontology shortcuts and taxonomy tree in the editing viewThe modelling process is augmented by a context-sensitive interface throughout, which offers definitions of classes, scope information, and help texts. As instances are added to the knowledge base, these are used to populate data lists that can be used to speed up the process of filling in the forms to create the triples.Contribution and further workThe ECPA modelling tool presented here takes knowledge modelling as a method of semantic integration and applies it in an integrated manner to the literary study of a coherent corpus of eighteenth-century poetry, thus arriving at a fully-fledged implementation of a research environment for literary scholars8, which enables the creation, representation, and long-term preservation of the scholarly analysis of the poems. Most importantly, as a participatory methodology to produce and organize shared knowledge, it facilitates new types of collaboration.By making our research reproducible, extensible, and thanks to the ontological underpinnings, machine-understandable, we also embrace the machine's capacity for reasoning as an important way of producing new insights. Once a big enough set of models has been created, we can use computers to analyse them, reason upon them, and help us to not only store these knowledge bases, but build on them to create new knowledge. This step connects to ongoing efforts, primarily in scientific, legal, and medical contexts, to arrive at formalized argumentative models through context-guided argumentation mining. Underpinning these efforts with a common ontology should contribute to a set of coherently structured if unevenly granular knowledge representations. Ultimately, I expect these models to constitute a dataset that will be useful for the computationally-assisted interpretation of the poems. I hope to show that knowledge models are thus ideally suited not only to enhance our ability to ask bigger questions by semantically integrating different strands of scholarly arguments, but also through sharing and collaboration, aggregation and combination are capable of telling bigger stories.The paper will demo the research environment, will cover the technology layer underpinning it (RDF store and library, triple generation, graph representation, and interface components such as serializations and storage formats), and will report on outreach efforts and uptake.NotesI have adopted the CIDOC-CRM family of ontologies as core ontologies for this work: http://www.cidoc-crm.org/collaborationshttps://www.researchspace.org/As early as 1990 Helmut Bonheim has argued for the benefits of formalization in literary studies in his book Literary Systematics (Cambridge, 1990). The field of Digital Humanities has long acknowledged the centrality of knowledge modelling as one of its core activities, pertinent contributions by Willard McCarty, Øyvind Eide, and Fabio Ciotti, among others testify to its centrality.Eighteenth Century Poetry Archive https://www.eighteenthcenturypoetry.org/There is no reason why this tool couldn’t be published in a generic stand-alone fashion, however, its integration with a literary corpus as well as other tools such as close reading and visualization tools in ECPA provides benefits of contextualization not otherwise easily achievable.Via Cytoscape.js http://js.cytoscape.org/These shortcuts are based on the CIDOC-CRM's idea of using ""Fundamental Categories"" (FC) and ""Fundamental Relationships"" (FR) for querying CRM-based repositories.The ECPA project has been integrating digital tools into its textual corpus from inception, firmly believing that it is through integration of object and tool we achieve deeper contextualization and better outputs.",alexander@hubers.org.uk,Long Presentation

Digitizing and Curating Colonial Records from the Caribbean and Central and South America for Public OutreachOverviewWhen digitizing and curating the colonial past, digital objects are not simply surrogates, but also ways of seeing and interpreting the world: slavery, colonization, and transculturation are embedded in any document, and if interrogated, their digital representations can become tools for understanding the impact of imperialism and colonialism in the present.Consequently, digitization and curation of nineteenth-century Caribbean and Central American collections give rise to new questions and challenges in the field of DH: How can we preserve endangered documents while keeping in mind their present-day needs & concerns? How can we digitize and give access to documents dispersed across international institutions to create meaningful collections around slavery? How can we curate data to imagine and visualize space beyond--often artificially imposed--geographical and temporal constraints? Or how can create digital records about oppressed people that transcend their oppressors?This panel brings together a diverse group of researchers from the Caribbean, South America, Central America, and Europe in order to place digitization and curatorial practices within the analytic framework of cultural encounter described as “post-colonial computing” (Dourish, 2010: 91) and of the post-custodial institutional partnership model (Kelleher, 2017; Alpert-Abrams, Bliss, & Carbajal, 2019). While these encounters and partnerships enable new and exciting collaborations, their processes, epistemological conditions, and products should be critically examined in order not to replicate neo-colonial attitudes often ingrained in digital technologies, and instead support local communities and promote public outreach.The panel addresses one of the main themes of the conference--“the historical and continued impacts of colonialism, postcolonialism, and hegemony”--and talks will be both in English (Hubert and Levi) and Spanish (Rojas Castro, Kraft and Kraller, and Afanador-Llach); presenters will provide translations to facilitate dialogue between participants and audience.Protecting Haitian Patrimony Initiatives at the Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC)Hadassah St. HubertCLIR Postdoctoral FellowDigital Library of the Caribbean at Florida International University hsthuber@fiu.eduHow can we protect and preserve endangered archives in Haiti? In 2010, Digital Library of the Caribbean (dLOC) launched the Protecting Haitian Patrimony Initiative, which builds on strong, existing long term partnerships, with an emphasis on accountability and transparency. This talk will focus on the numerous digitization projects, digital exhibits created since the launch of the initiative, and how dLOC engages the public.dLOC built Haiti: An Island Luminous, a tri-lingual website to help readers learn about Haiti’s history. “Haiti: An Island Luminous” combines rare books, manuscripts, and photos scanned by archives and libraries in Haiti and the United States with commentary by over one hundred (100) authors from universities around the world. “Haiti: An Island Luminous” contextualizes hundreds of historical books, documents and photos digitally preserved by dLOC’s partners, including the National Archives of Haiti, the National Library of Haiti, Haitian Library of the Fathers of the Holy Spirit (Pères du St-Esprit), Haitian Library of the Brothers of Christian Instruction (Frères de l’Instruction Chrètienne), University of Florida, Brown University, and University of Central Florida.dLOC currently hosts over 40,000 titles with more than four million pages of content, much of which is accessible content related to Haiti. Since the launch of “Haiti: An Island Luminous”, exhibit stations were placed in the Little Haiti Cultural Center, Nova Southeastern University’s Museum of Art, Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center and more recently at North Miami Public Library in an effort to reach an even larger audience.dLOC partners in Haiti have been able to contribute more digital content due to the efforts of many scholars that have collaborated to apply for Endangered Archive Programme grants, as well as support from the World Bank, the U.S. Embassy in Haiti, and the Haitian Studies Association. All of these efforts have made dLOC the largest open access repository of Caribbean content and a significant resource for finding materials from and about the Caribbean for use in teaching, research, cultural and community life.Reconstruyendo la huella de Humboldt en Cuba. Retos y oportunidades de la digitalización del patrimonio documental cubano-alemán del siglo XIXAntonio Rojas Castro, Tobias Kraft y Kathrin KrallerBerlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaftenantonio.rojas-castro@bbaw.dekraft@bbaw.dekathrin.kraller@bbaw.deGrisel Terrón, Eritk Guerra y Alaina SolernouOficina del Historiador de la Ciudad de La Habanagrisel@patrimonio.ohc.cueritk@dic.ohc.cualaina@patrimonio.ohc.cuCon esta comunicación pretendemos debatir sobre los principales retos y oportunidades que supone la cooperación, en el marco del Proyecto Humboldt Digital (ProHD), entre la Academia de las Ciencias y las Humanidades de Berlín (BBAW) y la Casa Humboldt de la Oficina del Historiador de la Ciudad de La Habana (OHCH). En concreto, nos gustaría responder a la siguiente pregunta: ¿cómo podemos cooperar para el beneficio mutuo (Sennett, 2012)? A continuación, analizaremos el estado actual de la digitalización y las Humanidades Digitales en Cuba. Por último, expondremos los primeros avances orientados hacia la construcción de un repositorio digital y la edición de documentos.El futuro repositorio digital de ProHD tiene por objetivo preservar y dar acceso en línea a varias colecciones de documentos de naturaleza transnacional y multilingüe (español, francés y alemán), que permitan reconstruir no solo la “huella” del científico prusiano, sino también el pensamiento de muchos intelectuales y políticos locales, como Francisco Arango y Parreño, y las condiciones en que se producía el negocio esclavista, por ejemplo, mediante la digitalización de facturas de compra y venta. De esta manera, al poner la figura de Alexander von Humboldt en su contexto histórico, los usuarios obtendrán una mirada nueva y completa al problema de la esclavitud y al funcionamiento del sistema colonial, que condenaba a Cuba al monocultivo y a importar bienes de primera necesidad procedentes de la Metrópolis.A fin de obtener digitalizaciones y ediciones académicas digitales fáciles de encontrar, accesibles, interoperables y sostenibles, se han planeado tres medidas principales, que están implementándose desde junio de 2019: en primer lugar, se ha adquirido equipamiento para reforzar la infraestructura tecnológica (ordenadores, escáneres de alta resolución, servidor, impresora, mobiliario, etc.) de la Casa Humboldt en La Habana en donde se llevará a cabo la digitalización de los documentos; en segundo lugar, se ha formado a los miembros del equipo mediante cursos (en línea, sobre todo a partir del confinamiento provocado por la COVID-19) sobre el proceso de digitalización, la creación de metadatos y la gestión de repositorios digitales. Por último, se han definido de manera conjunta unos criterios de selección de documentos, una política de digitalización y un flujo de trabajo compartido.Inventar el virreinato de la Nueva Granada: curaduría crítica de fuentes primarias y la construcción de conjuntos de datos espaciales, 1739-1810María José Afanador-LlachUniversidad de los Andes, Colombiamj.afanador28@uniandes.edu.coLa invención del virreinato del Nuevo Reino de Granada (hoy Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador y Panamá) en 1739 respondió a un proyecto económico de la monarquía española para proteger el norte de Suramérica de incursiones extranjeras y extraer mayores recursos para la corona. Dicho proyecto de búsqueda de unidad administrativa y geográfica se nutrió de la producción de conocimiento sobre economía política, es decir, sobre cómo crear riqueza en contextos de competencia. En fuentes primarias como mapas, textos sobre economía y descripciones geográficas creados por burócratas, naturalistas y militares en la colonia, se evidencian las dificultades de integrar un territorio montañoso y extenso y la importancia de la imaginación geográfica en este proceso.El proyecto de integración territorial del virreinato se rompió con la crisis monárquica de 1808 cuando el reino se fragmentó en más de una docena de provincias autónomas. La crisis representó una oportunidad para que pueblos y ciudades avanzaran sus proyectos económicos locales y se imaginaran espacios económicos post-coloniales. La pregunta central que guía este proyecto es: ¿cómo se puede visualizar la relación entre la búsqueda de unidad territorial en el norte de Suramérica y la diversidad de paisajes y economías políticas en tensión en una interfaz de archivo y un mapa digital?Esta ponencia explora los avances de este proyecto en sus dos primeras fases. La primera fase consiste en la curaduría crítica de fuentes primarias entre 1739 y 1810. Esta curaduría consiste en la selección de documentos, de fragmentos dentro de los documentos y de mapas del periodo, para organizarlos, enriquecer sus metadatos y disponerlos alrededor de un argumento y una narrativa histórica. Algunos de estos documentos se encuentran disponibles en libros editados, otros están digitalizados y un número pequeño se digitalizará. La segunda fase consiste la formulación de un proceso metodológico para extraer datos sobre las dimensiones espaciales y de economía política de este conjunto curado de fuentes primarias. Se trata de generar conjuntos de datos relacionales que permitan visualizar, analizar e interpretar transformaciones históricas-espaciales de la invención y crisis del virreinato de la Nueva Granada y los actores involucrados en este proceso. El proyecto busca que tanto la curaduría de fuentes primarias como los conjuntos de datos sean recursos abiertos en español para la investigación y docencia sobre el periodo. La ponencia discutirá los retos a los que se ha enfrentado el proyecto hasta el momento en términos de la curaduría de documentos y la definición metodológica para la extracción de datos.Beyond digitization: Engaging the Community to Decolonize the Archival Record for the EnslavedAmalia S. LeviArchivist, ChairThe HeritEdge Connection, Barbadosamalia@heritedge.foundationDuring 2018 and 2019, two historic newspapers, The Barbados Mercury Gazette (1783-1848) and The Barbadian (1822-1861), housed in the Barbados Department of Archives, were digitized through Endangered Archives Programme grants. As primary sources, they offer a detailed view of every aspect of the dystopian life in a British colony in the Caribbean during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Digitization offers unparalleled access to these colonial newspapers that were previously largely inaccessible due to their fragility.The presentation goes beyond digitization to discuss what happens after digitization is completed. Considering that the newspapers were part of the colonial information apparatus, how do we read against the grain to locate and reveal marginalized voices hidden in the digitized pages?If our aim is to “lift” the voices of the enslaved from the pages, and retrospectively create a body of archival records, we need to provide access to the digitized pages as data. Such information however exists “locked” in digitized images that due to the deterioration of the paper and the discoloration of the pages are impossible to OCR. Finding and transcribing these ads is necessarily a manual process, at present.Among the wealth of information appearing regularly in the newspapers, of particular importance are the “runaway slaves” ads. Archives usually preserve very little descriptive information about the enslaved, because their lived experiences were rarely recorded. When they appear in the archival record, they are enumerated or appraised as commodities. Thus these ads offer a rich trove of information about individual people, including name, age, physical appearance, skin color, clothing, accent, distinguishing features (such as body modifications from their country of origin or bodily harm, the result of violence), friends, relatives, and skills.Digitization does not solve the gaps, silences, and omissions inherent in the archival record and the colonial epistemologies they contain. Colonial newspapers reflect the voices of the white class of planters, merchants, and colonial authorities. Simply digitizing and putting online risks elevating and amplifying the very colonial worldviews we mean to avoid.To decolonize the record about the enslaved, digitization is only the starting point for further projects and initiatives to engage the community with its own history. Recent scholarship and public humanities efforts have shown that it is possible to challenge the erasure of colonial archival sources and read between the lines to tease out information that is not readily visible.  Our aim is to create a collection of material by clipping “runaway slaves” ads from the digitized newspapers, transcribing the text, and enriching the human stories in each ad with additional contextual information. More specifically, the first part of the presentation will focus on work to develop the “Barbados Runaway Slaves Digital Collection,” a partnership between the Barbados Archives, the local non-profit HeritEdge Connection, and the Early Caribbean Digital Archive (ECDA) at Northeastern University (Boston).This digital collection aims to foreground the centrality of enslaved voices by ‘lifting’ ads of individuals who chose to escape slavery from the pages of the newspapers, and turning them into individual, standalone archival records previously unrecorded in the archives. When completed, the “Runaway Slaves Digital Collection” will provide a central location for collecting and presenting these ads, and other opportunities for the public, especially students, both in Barbados, as well as abroad, to interact with the material in creative ways.By ‘reading’ these ads in various ways and being able to ‘see’ them collectively, we can start seeing patterns and coping mechanisms. At the same time, the availability of this information points to what is not there, and invites us to be sensitive to gaps and silences.The second part of the presentation will discuss public outreach initiatives. Material digitized through generous grants by institutions in the Global North are eventually hosted in digital platforms in those institutions. While praiseworthy, digitization through such grants ends up benefiting scholars in the Global North. Usually local people are unaware of these platforms, and often unable to access them, either due to bandwidth issues or simply to interfaces that might not be intuitive to use. We have tried to remedy this by focusing on public history work we are doing to increase awareness of and engagement with these digitized colonial records.During the fall of 2019, we conducted a series of workshops aimed to familiarize the public with accessing the newspapers online and to transcribe ads. The workshops also provided a platform for the public to discuss the ads, and the many facets of slavery. People were able to see ancestors who chose to resist and escape bondage in adverse, inhumane conditions. Due to COVID-19, workshops planned for 2020 are being held online. The aim of these workshops is to engage people with the ads in creative ways, through genealogical research, speculative writing, or digital methods. In this way, we invite the public to contextualize the ads through their local knowledge of places mentioned in the ads, or intimate information about lived experiences. Beyond information that is there, we also hope that workshop participants can imagine what is not there, complete the stories, and give enslaved individuals their place in the archival record.Additionally, the digitization of these primary sources has great potential for digital projects by students and other researchers that can highlight various aspects of the island’s history. The “runaway slaves” ads help people challenge the customary narrative of Barbadian passivity and submissiveness to slavery; reconstruct family and community networks that supported enslaved Barbadians; and they help give voice to ancestors, whom colonial records intentionally left voiceless.","hsthuber@fiu.edu, antonio.rojas-castro@bbaw.de, kraft@bbaw.de, kathrin.kraller@bbaw.de, mj.afanador28@uniandes.edu.co, amalia@heritedge.foundation",Panel

The spread of literacy in the Russian Empire in the late XIX-early XX centuries was largely associated with the activities of local self-government bodies. For them one of the most important areas of work was public education. The well-known fact is that the local self-government reform was carried in 1864. In Russian, these local self-government bodies were called Zemstvo.These local self-government bodies did not have political functions, they dealt with building roads, improving streets, opening and maintaining schools and churches.My field of research concerns the problems of the local self-government bodies activity in the Perm province (Russian Empire). Perm Zemstvo was established in 1870. At that time, Perm Zemstvo founded more than 2000 educational establishments which contributed to the development of literacy.The Perm local self-government separately considered the issues of the creation and development of the indigenous non-Russian schools. The largest non-Russian population in the Perm province was Permian, Tatar and Bashkir (according to the population census of 1897 the Permian population was 92642, Tatar-46711, Bashkir-85395). The Perm local self-government founded specific non-Russian schools for these peoples.I am collecting information about each of the educational establishments of Zemstvo in Perm. Currently I am working on database creation. This database allows keeping and processing information about the educational establishments such as names of these educational establishments, location, the time of their work, the number and name of teachers, subjects and textbooks.This database will be posted publicly on the Internet. Teachers can use this database in the educational process for schoolchildren and students, as well as organize educational projects together with museums, archives, libraries and educational institutions. Researchers will be able to use the database to conduct a local history research and research in the field of public history. Students, schoolchildren and researchers are likely find in this database information about their schools which in the late 19th and early 20th centuries functioned as schools of Zemstvo.",ilianaismakaeva9@gmail.com,Poster

IvanovMichael Ridley Postdoctoral FellowUniversity of GuelphDH 2020This paper presents a doctoral project on the digital curation practices at the news archive of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) (Ivanov 2019). The CBC archive is the largest news media archive in Canada, with over 500,000 hours of digital archival holdings dating back to the 1950s. Data for the project were collected through an organizational ethnography at the CBC news archive’s headquarters in Toronto, Canada ([FN1]). The project examined how archivists at the CBC evaluate, transform, enrich, and reuse archival news materials and sought to understand how organizational and computational processes and systems intersect with human factors in digital curation practice ([FN 2]). This paper describes the project’s approach and summarizes its main findings and conclusions.Broadcasting news archives provide rich, sometimes visceral, representations of the past. This makes them a vital element of broadcasting journalism's visual language, where they serve as “mnemonic devices” for reconstructing the past (Conboy 2012). But news archives are more than storerooms of information. They are products of a time and place, created through the articulation of different kinds of practices and technologies. As archival ethnographies demonstrate, rather than mere storerooms, archives are more accurately described as dynamic sites of knowledge-making in which different forms of knowledge about the past are configured through information practices such as selection, classification, and organization (Gracy 2004).The study presented in this paper amplifies the semiotic and material dimension of the digital curation practices at the CBC news archive. It does so by taking up an approach developed for the study of knowledge-making in the sciences and applying it to the curation of the CBC archive, positioning the latter as a sub-set of “social knowledge making” (Camic, Gross, and Lamont 2011). The fundamental assumption of this approach is that neither the social world of actors and actions, the material world of objects and technologies, nor the cultural world of meanings and symbols could be coherently organized or function independently from one another. They are all intertwined in what Barad (2003) calls practices of matter and meaning through which the world comes “to matter.” One way to understand these three worlds is to examine the overlapping social, material, and cultural arrangements and mechanisms that bind them together within the context of historically situated expert systems of knowing (Knorr Cetina 1999). In less abstract terms, then, using this approach asks the analyst to ‘open’ practices of knowledge-making, read and organize their contents and symbols, and analyze how they are used.Following prior work in this analytical tradition, in my dissertation, I analyzed the organizational structures and social interactions at the CBC news archive and the information systems and tools of curation (Latour 1987). I also examined how cultural and symbolic elements such as rules, norms, beliefs, and codes provide strategies for action that allow archivists at the CBC to address pragmatic problems in their immediate environment (Swidler 1986). Lastly, I examined how information is evaluated through the digital curation lifecycle at the CBC news archive, focusing on the methods of comparison, criteria, conventions, and tools supporting these evaluations (Beljean, Chong, and Lamont 2016).What I found is that the organizational structure of the CBC news archive resembles the axioms of a networked organization, similar to other contemporary knowledge organizations (e.g., software firms). This work environment is characterized by interactions within and across teams and constant information and knowledge exchange. The CBC archivists are expected to develop expertise on the job through an apprenticeship and are hired only in terms of their suitability for this type of work. When hiring new employees, the management seeks for either one of two signals of suitability: training in broadcasting journalism (demonstrated by work experience or a graduate degree) or information management (demonstrated by a library and archival graduate degree). The rationale, I was told, is that the former group understands what makes good journalism, and the latter how to select, classify, catalogue, and organize information. Once on the job, the archivists are expected to master both—they need to learn how to recognize the codes and conventions of journalism and how to manage data and information in complex information systems. It is already in these rudimentary job requirements that the semiotic and material dimensions of digital curation come to analytical light.              Curation practices at the CBC have been evolving gradually for decades since the founding of the archive in the late 1930s, but established ways of working were upended by the organization’s digital transformation in 2008. One consequence of digitization is that news archivists took on a more proactive role in the production of news. They become embedded into the newsroom to anticipate, rather than react to, editorial needs. Digitization accelerated the transfer of information, and consequently, the pace at which work is experienced, creating new pressures and demands for accuracy. Videotapes (as media carriers) were replaced by a complex set of digital assets, some of which are highly unstable and could be easily altered. This made it more difficult to determine and document the identity and integrity of news materials, as doing so required a new set of evaluative criteria and practices ([FN 3]).The digital transformation of the CBC also led to the introduction of new information and media management systems, whose adoption resulted in unanticipated changes to due process at the workplace (Gerson and Star 1986). This is because while the new information systems archivists had to learn how to use are state-of-the-art, they are designed with the goals of media production in mind. The “affordances” of these systems presented material and semiotic challenges to the established ways of conceptualizing, representing, and doing curation at the CBC (Gibson 2014 [1979]). As my analysis suggests, the material challenges are addressed through information systems workarounds (Alter 2014). The semiotic challenges, on the other hand, are addressed by developing home-grown file classifications systems that map onto organizational structures and function as sense-making mechanisms that represent the spatial temporal, and causal relatedness among different organizational actors and the archival holdings (Weick 1995).Lastly, I interviewed my research participants to learn more about the evaluative practices in their work, asking them questions about the various forms of decision-making strategies and heuristics they apply in the selection, cataloguing, and retrieval of archival news materials. This analysis, most broadly, indicates that evaluative practices are consequential during all stages of the curation lifecycle but are particularly salient at the stages of acquisition (when value is established), cataloguing (when value is enriched), and reuse (when value is negotiated to fit into a new context).Beyond that, my interview data suggest that at the CBC news archive evaluation occurs within both situated and institutional frameworks of understanding in practice (Ivanov 2020). Archivists base their evaluations of archival news materials in the CBC archival policy—which succinctly outlines three value criteria: cultural-value, significance to the corporation, and reuse—as well as in the codes and conventions of broadcasting journalism (which often entails making aesthetics judgements about the content and visual quality of news materials). But as my analysis further suggests, when the archival policy and the codes and conventions of broadcasting journalism cannot provide concrete strategies for action, archivists draw on their subjective experiences, taste, and preferences in evaluation. They, thus, base their evolutions on what institutions identify as valuable but equally so on what they, based on their subjective experiences, recognize as valuable. The intertwinement of institutional and situated frameworks in evaluation differs depending on the situation, the archivist doing the evaluation, the type of materials evaluated, and the goals of evaluation (e.g., for acquisition, cataloguing, or reuse), but it consistently recurs. The outcomes of these evaluations are inscribed in the materiality of the archive in various ways as they are written into item- and collection-level metadata records, taxonomies, indices, and classification systems.In conclusion, based on these findings, I propose that aside from being supported by socio-technical systems, digital curation practices are also supported by cultural systems. These cultural systems sustain collective action and situated cognition by providing vocabularies of motives and strategies for action that cohere in a curation culture. Second, I propose that evaluative practices are an integral part of digital curation and a prerequisite for enhancing the value of digital materials. They are imbricated in institutional and situated frameworks of understanding, and while computationally imperfect are practically indispensable. It is in the context of evaluation, I thus argue, that human intelligence and judgment most saliently influence the semiotic and material outcomes of digital curation practice.         FOOTNOTES:[FN1] — For my methodology see Ivanov (2019, 98-107); See also summary in Ivanov (2020, 2892-2893).[FN2] — Digital curation is defined as “the active management of data or digital materials through their lifecycle with the goal of ensuring their preservation, enhancing their value, and facilitating their use and reuse” (See, Dallas 2016, 430; See also, Higgins 2008).[FN3] — In archival science, the evaluation of the integrity and identity of archival records are key perquisites for determining their authenticity and reliability (Duranti 1995).

IntroductionHaiku is a Japanese poetic form renowned for its brevity and expressiveness. Haiku derives from renga/renku – collaborative collections of verses with a 3-line opening hokku verse in the form 5-7-5 on (equiv. syllable). Matsuo Basho made famous the stand-alone hokku form, preserving the 5-7-5 on structure. The name haiku was associated with this form of hokku during 19th century.Four haiku authors rise in prominence above all: Matsuo Basho (17th century) is considered the “father” of haiku. Yosa Buson (18th century) focused on haiku as an art rather than a reflection of reality. Buson combined hokku with painting, inventing haiga (verse-painting). Kobayashi Issa (18-19th century) reinvented haiku through his depth of feeling and humanism. In the second half of the 19th century, Masaoka Shiki critically re-evaluated the art of haiku (coining the term), braking away from the traditional 5-7-5 form, and popularizing the poetic style beyond Japan.We present a study, which employs authorship attribution techniques to determine the distinctiveness of poetic styles in haiku, focusing on the poetry of Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki. There has been little work in the field of haiku attribution. A theoretical study of phonological complexity in haiku was presented in [1]. An approach to automatic evaluation of the quality of haiku was presented in [2]. An interesting work [3] deals with identifying unintended haiku in text. We approach haiku attribution as a classification problem: Given a set of attributed haikus, we train classifiers to recognize the writing style of each poet, and apply an ensemble of trained models to unattributed texts.2. Our Haiku Corpus The first step in creating our model was obtaining a haiku corpus. There are three approaches:Use actual haikus written in hiragana (a form of Japanese alphabet)Use Roman alphabet transcriptions (rōmaji) of haikus.Use English translations of haikus.While using hiragana haikus is arguably the best option, our software lacks the capability to process hiragana text. English translations of haikus are readily available, but while research suggests that the authorial signal is stronger than the translators’ [4], we do not know if that applies to haiku. We opted to construct a corpus of rōmaji transcribed haikus. This was difficult since most resources are either hiragana originals or translations. We obtained 723 haikus by Basho from [5], 842 haikus by Buson from [6], and 603 haikus by Issa from [7]. Finding transcribed Shiki haikus proved extremely challenging. Even though Shiki wrote over 24000 haikus, only a handful have been transcribed into rōmaji. Failing to secure transcriptions, we downloaded the full set of 24000 hiragana haikus from [8]. We then used an online hiragana-to-rōmaji transcription tool [9] to transcribe 967 randomly selected haikus by Shiki. Since many of the extracted haikus were organized alphabetically or by topic, we wrote Python code to randomly shuffle the order of the haikus for each author. A different program broke up the haikus into files of size 50 haikus each.3. Attribution MethodologyOur attribution software is a based on JGAAP [10] and implements an ensemble of classifier/stylistic-feature pairs [11,12]. For this study, we limited the set of stylistic features to character-2/3/4/5-grams (CnG), word-2/3-grams (WnG), vowel-initiated words (VIW), and first-word-in-sentence (FWIS). The classifiers used were support vector machines with sequential minimal optimization (SMO) and multilayer perceptrons (MLP).4. ResultsWe conducted several experiments, where we randomly chose one 50-haiku file for each author and removed it from the training set. We trained the classifiers on the remaining set of haikus using leave-one-out (L1O) validation. The results of the training for three sets of experiments are presented in Table 1:Table 1: Training Accuracy for Basho, Buson, Issa, and ShikiNext, we tested the authorship of the 50-haiku files that were left out of the training. The results of those experiments are presented in Table 2:Table 2: Attribution Results for Basho, Buson, Issa, and ShikiIt is quite clear that even with a reduced set of stylistic features, the attribution is very strong and the author identification definitive. We conducted an additional set of experiments, where we used each of the trained models to test the authorship of five haikus by the 18th century haiku poet Takarai Kikaku. The models were not trained on Kikaku, so, as expected, the results were split among two or more authors (Table 3):Table 3: Attribution Results for KikakuInterestingly, Kikaku was a prominent student and disciple of Basho, yet none of the models makes that association. This is most likely due to the small number of Kikaku haikus tested.5. Conclusion and Future WorkWe presented results from haiku author identification experiments, which suggest that haiku authorship can be determined even with a limited set of stylistic features from rōmaji-transcribed haikus. Our next efforts will be to experiment with a larger set of haiku authors, with English translations, and, possibly, with hiragana haikus. Among the questions we wish to answer are:What is the minimal set of haikus sufficient to identify an author?Is the authorial signal stronger than the translator’s for haiku translations?Can prosodic features be used for haiku author identification? Does the historical period affect the accuracy of attribution?",livanov@iona.edu,Short Presentation

Undertaking this type of rich and subject-driven data mining permits the exploration of the relationship between forms of labor in Moravian congregations and their relationship to a broader understanding of work in the 18th century. It also provides a platform for further investigation of contemporary religious societies.Historically, the membership of the Moravian Church in the United Kingdom, like the Methodist Church of the Wesleys, has been seen as consisting primarily of men and women from the working class whose artisan and laborer skills were fundamentally redeployed by the advent of large-scale industrial production in the North of England. Thanks to the Moravian custom of writing a memoir these working people left autobiographical documents that include details of their working lives. For the most part unstudied, these English-language memoir collections provide historians with a treasure-trove of new archival material, written by the working-class members of the church.Recent scholarship on the intersection of gender, industry and religion (See Hammond and Forsaith, 2011) has begun to explore how these concepts were transformed by the early Industrial Revolution and provide a welcome revision to the dominant historiographical narrative of the British working class. (As inscribed by E.P. Thompson, Making of the English Working Class, 1963.) This corpus of unpublished and mostly uncatalogued material allows us to examine the sentiments directed towards labor and office respectively.Since 2014, the Moravian Lives project (moravianlives.org) has undertaken the work of transcribing, encoding, and data-mining the memoirs written by thousands of Moravians in Europe, North America, and the Caribbean. Recently the project team has turned its attention to the English congregations, with a focus on revealing prosopographical information within of the memoirs.Using the Fulneck memoirs as our corpus, we have begun the process of harvesting this prosopographical data through semantic text encoding  detailed personography, minting unique identifiers and capturing data about key life and religious events. In the process of so doing, we have realized that we were also producing unique ontology of Moravian offices and occupations undertaken by these Moravians, within their community and within broader regional context. (See Eide, and Ciotti and Tomasi for an outline of challenges of using TEI XML for this kind of intensive semantic work.and data modeling.)By July 2020 the Moravian Lives project team will be able to report on the status of the prosopography and ontology. More importantly, we will be able to present initial analysis of the connections this work enables us to reveal - between male and female members of the “economies”, the shifts we detect in types of labour from the 1740s through the 1790s, and how this methodological approach might be used as a model for other research projects focusing on concurrent evangelist movements, and those concentrating more broadly on related themes and trends to do with the Industrial Revolution.","dkj004@bucknell.edu, faull@bucknell.edu, jes083@bucknell.edu",Short Presentation

At the same time, it is important to make (digital) humanities scholars literate in dealing with visualizations to ensure that accurate conclusions can be drawn. In order to make younger generations ready for interdisciplinary work in a digital humanities context, I taught a module that attracted both computer science and humanities students. This article reflects on the most important aspects in teaching the course throughout three years.Cohort of studentsTeaching needs to be flexibly organized in dependency on the backgrounds of students joining a course. A course might be offered exclusively for either humanities or computer science students, or it can attract students with diverse study subjects. I faced different constellations, and emphasized different aspects according to the demands of the cohort. Whereas humanities students profit from more intense discussions on computational thinking and data modeling, it is especially helpful for computer science students to get to know typical research interests and traditional workflows of humanities scholars. The major focus should be to ensure that students, independent of their backgrounds, learn to “speak the same language” using the same terminology.Teaching visualization theoryTo serve students with an easy-to-digest overview of visualization design, I recommend Tamara Munzner’s book “Visualization Analysis and Design” (Munzner, 2014). It provides an introduction to data and task abstraction that are necessary to comprehend and to develop new or adapt existing visualizations. It further discusses how data features can be appropriately mapped to visual features, and how users can interact with visualizations. Also, emphasis should be devoted to Shneiderman’s Information Seeking Mantra “Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand” (Shneiderman, 1996) as it encapsulates the general idea of quantitative data analysis without losing the materials a visualization is composed of. This rather theoretical frame should be accomplished with discussing visualization techniques that are of particular importance for digital humanities research: geographical maps, timelines, tag clouds, heat maps and graphs.Ready-to-use-based vs. development-driven visualizationsNext to theoretical contents, the course should have a strong focus on practical work. It is known that different approaches to make use of visualization for knowledge discovery in digital humanities applications exist (Jänicke, 2016). The first approach is to apply ready-to-use tools like Voyant (Sinclair and Rockwell, 2020) for quantitative visual text analysis or Gephi (Bastian et al., 2009) for graph visualization. While the advantage of using such frameworks is generating arguable visual output in a short amount of time, research interests might deviate from what the tool can provide. Further, scholars need to learn how to use potentially complex tools and how to interpret upcoming results. In contrast to applying existing tools to generate visualizations, (digital) humanities and visualization scholars might also engage with each other aiming to generate a new visual vocabulary to expedite knowledge discovery, thereby facing the problems of interdisciplinary collaborations. While the first approach should be carried out simultaneously to the theoretical sessions, I recommend to conduct interdisciplinary student projects in the second part of the course.Supervisory roles during project workTraining to apply the learned visualization-related terminology should be the main focus of a project, while the visualization result itself plays a secondary role. Especially in a setting with mixed backgrounds, students should be engaged to think about potentially interesting project ideas. Each conducted project should include at least one participant with a (digital) humanities and one with a computer science background to expedite interdisciplinary exchange. This constraint generates different supervisory roles:The Mediator: Projects involve students having a computer science and a humanities background alike. The entire project is managed by the students, whereas the teacher might supervise in the form of a mediator during meetings. While students face typical pitfalls of interdisciplinary projects, such projects still brought forth considerable results, one of which is shown in Figure 1.The Real & the Fake Humanities Scholar: When the number of students with a humanities background is too low, project groups that only include computer science students need to be complemented with domain experts. For some of the projects, I was able to involve partners from the humanities, the real humanities scholars, with research interests targeted towards available data sets. This setting generated very good results (see Figure 2) and guaranteed the steepest learning curve for computer science students as they cooperated with domain experts experienced in digital humanities. However, for some projects I, educated in computer science, needed to act as a humanities scholar, being the least favorable setting as only fake interdisciplinary discussions are possible.The Helper: On the other hand, the number of computer science students joining a course might be limited. In that case, I could advise students in the role of a computer scientist, better suitable considering my own background. The focus in such projects was rather on data modeling and acquisition as well as applying existing tools and libraries than developing new solutions. An example is shown in Figure 3.Figure 1: The mediator project developed a method to semi-automatically extract biographical information about members of the German Bundestag in 2019, and the adapted stream visualization allows multifaceted exploration of biographical features.Figure 2: The real humanities scholar project focused on the development of an interactive tag cloud that supports composing engineering branches based on the study subjects of engineering professors. More information can be found in a related publication on the project (Meinecke and Jänicke, 2018).Figure 3: The helper project focused on the contents published at three German websites known for publishing fake news articles. For comparatively analyzing the results, the TagPies visualization (Jänicke et al., 2018) was adapted.I recommend making such courses accessible to all students as it prepares them best for potential future collaborations in a digital humanities context. More detailed information on theoretical contents, conducted student projects and course reflections can be found in my related IVAPP article (Jänicke, 2020).",stjaenicke@imada.sdu.dk,Short Presentation

These include the changing ideas about women since the mid-twentieth century, which is the subject of this paper.We used supervised machine learning to extract 327,322 visual images of faces from an archive of Time magazine, which contains 3389 issues ranging from 1923 to 2014, and computationally classified the faces as male or female. We then closely read selected Time articles to make sense of this quantitative data against the background of postwar feminism writ-large, and the history of the magazine itself. Our focus is on the period between the 1940s and the 1990s, which witnessed significant changes in attitudes toward women, and where our data of the proportion of female faces exhibits significant fluctuation.We found four clear phases in the visual representation of women in Time from the 1940s to the 1990s: a peak in the mid-to-late 1940s, a dip from the mid-1950s to early 1960s, another peak in the 1970s, and another dip in the 1980s. The number of female faces depicted in Time then rises steadily since the early-1990s. We interpret these variations through an interdisciplinary framework. Through our combined quantitative and qualitative approach, we found that the percentage of female faces found in Time between 1940 and 1990 correlates with attitudes towards women in both the larger historical context as well as within the textual content of the magazine.Methods and ResultsWe first collected data through human labor using Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to identify and tag faces from the archive. This data was used to train a RetinaNet detector to automatically identify and extract faces from the remainder of the archive. Using an accuracy threshold of 90 percent yielded 327,322 faces. A pre-trained face descriptor convolutional neural network VGGFace was then fine-tuned and used to classify each face as either male or female.Similar patterns emerge from both the AMT data and the automated data, featuring an increase in the proportion of female faces from the 1920s to 1945, a post-Second World War dip, a rebound beginning in the mid-1960s, followed by a decrease in the 1980’s, and a final rebound beginning in the early-1990s. Since similar trend lines were found using the AMT and the automatic extraction data, our analysis focuses on the latter, more comprehensive data set.The proportion of women in each issue is shown in Figure 1. While there is a significant amount of variance per issue (compared to when the data is aggregated per year), a clear trendline emerges when the data is Lowess smoothed. Charting the proportion of women in each issue was useful for identifying outliers for our close reading analysis.Figure 1: The percentage of women’s faces in each issue. The solid line is a Lowess smoothed version of the data.To interpret the image data, we analyzed Time within the broader historical context of the 20th century. Our analysis consisted of a close reading of selected issues and articles, chosen based on the following criteria: 1) outlier issues from Fig. 2 defined as those between 1940 and 1990 with > 40% women, 2) issues and articles that were referenced in our secondary sources, and 3) results from EBSCO’s Academic Search Complete database, which we used to retrieve all articles in which the word ‘woman’ or ‘women’ or ‘housewife’ was mentioned within our dates of interest.Our quantitative data coincides closely with the findings of our qualitative analysis. The number of images of women in Time magazine increases during the second world war as women’s role in the workforce expanded beyond traditional ‘feminine’ occupations to fill the gap and to satisfy increased production in the defence industry. In the post-war years, the number images of women decreases as women across North America were instructed by “social engineers, such as psychologists, that they needed to be good wives and mothers in order to fit normally into post-war life”. Our close reading analysis revealed that during these years, notable women who made the news bore the label of ‘housewife’, regardless of whether or not they were actually a housewife. The number of images of women increases once again as the women’s liberation movement began to take shape in the mid-sixties, peaking at the height of the movement in the 1970s. During this time, the women’s movement pushed the institutional structure of Time magazine to change from a gender-based caste system to a more equitable work place[5]. In the 1980s, there is a decrease in images, and we believe that this drop in the representation of women is consistent with the analysis in Susan Faludi’s well-known book Backlash[6], in which she describes the 1980s as a decade that rejected feminism. The representation of women then starts increasing once again in the 1990s and onward.ConclusionWe found that a distant reading of the images of faces in Time magazine is consistent with a historical analysis of American socio-political trends and with a close reading of the magazine’s content. Specifically, we found that the percentage of female faces peaks during eras when women have been more active in public life, and wanes in eras of backlash against women’s rights. This finding is particularly relevant in our contemporary post-literate world in which people absorb culture through images, and spend more time scanning images than reading print content.","jofrea@sunypoly.edu, acole3@gmail.com, realemj@sunypoly.edu, berardi@chapman.edu",Long Presentation

For Dickens, illustrations were a way to attract readers and boost sales, as demonstrated by the commercial success of The Pickwick Papers (1837), as well as a crucial element of artistic expression. All but two of Dickens’s novels were illustrated, and his involvement in every stage of the illustration process was well documented. Dickens collaborated closely with his illustrators by providing detailed instructions: he provided specific colors for his illustrations, although the illustrations would be printed in black and white, and he intentionally positioned each illustration in a specific location in his serials in order to communicate details and emotions effectively with his readers. Scholars of Dickens’s works generally understand the illustrations to be integral to the text.Given the expense of printing illustrations in color, most of the illustrations in Dickens’s work were printed in black and white. However, the hand-colored illustrations in A Christmas Carol (1843) demonstrate both Dickens’s interest in providing color when he could, and the significance of color in interpreting design elements as well as shaping interpretation of Dickens’s text. Because colorizing Dickens’s illustrations has the potential for enhancing the reader’s understanding of the text, and for opening up new interpretive possibilities, it has pedagogical implications that we wish to explore.Our project is the first deep learning colorization venture in Victorian era media. We will colorize all of the illustrations in several of Dickens’s major novels, using the pix2pix model based on cGANs with Kim’s Victorian400 dataset as a research method. The Victorian400 dataset, published as an open data source, is a collection of colorful illustrations painted with nineteenth-century palettes. By using Victorian paintings and hand colored illustrations as a training set, our research methods make it possible for Dickens’s illustrations to be viewed with a Victorian color palette, approximating the color choices that a contemporary audience would have expected. We will present two groups of students with both the colorized and black and white illustrations and ask them to evaluate each in terms of design and in terms of their effect on their engagement with the text. Colorization with deep learning carries possibilities of misrepresentation or misinterpretation, which can be used to clarify students’ preconceptions about the nature or role of illustration and to spur creative responses to the text; it can also provide interest, anticipation, and imagination for readers. As a pedagogical tool, we hope that colorization using deep learning will improve students’ ability to think critically about the intersection of text and image while promoting deeper understanding and interest in Dickens’s works, and lay the groundwork for experimentation with deep learning colorization of other illustrated works by Victorian authors.","elibooklover@gmail.com, m-ives@tamu.edu",Poster

To answer research questions on historical urban space, such as human activities and environmental effects, historical documents should be integrated by place, time, person and other entities to turn small facts into a collection of structured data for historical big data analysis. Related work includes Pelagios, which studies historical gazetteers and georeferencing of old maps to reconstruct the geographic space, and European Time Machine, which aims at integrating historical entities to reconstruct the urban space in European cities. Our approach could also be called as Edo Time Machine. Integration of Historical Sources through GeocodingToponyms are described in many variations, especially on historical documents before the standardization of the address system. Hence a location-based historical database requires the shared address system, or the standard gazetteer, for toponym-based integration. Major challenges in toponym-based integration is variation and disambiguation of toponyms, and a question in this paper is how machine-based geocoding can deal with these challenges. DatasetEdo Map Dataset: The dataset covers place names extracted from “Edo Kiriezu” (Owariya version), a pre-modern map of Edo published from 1849 through 1863 in the form of 32 sheets. It contains not only addresses but also POIs (Point of Interests) such as bridges and temples.Edo Shopping Dataset: The dataset covers shops and restaurants extracted from “Edo Kaimono Hitori Annai”, a pre-modern shopping guide published in 1824 about 2600 shops and restaurants in Edo with the shop name, category, address and logo.To create the dataset, we took advantage of IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework), which allows interoperable image delivery in the humanities, and IIIF Curation Platform (ICP), which is an open source software suite developed by our group to create the collection of a part of images across organizations. As a result, we created the dataset of 6418 place names from 22 sheets out of 32 sheets, and the dataset of 2454 shops from the whole book. Figure 1: Edo Kiriezu, the sheet of Yotsuya area.

Experimental Results Table 1 shows the result of matching between an entry in the gazetteer and a shop address (1034 unique addresses). In addition to exact match, we tested three other approaches; matching from the first character (forward match), matching from the last character (backward match), and matching a part of the address string (partial match). Table 1 shows that exact match was successful for about 21% (212/1034). Among the 212 successful cases, 49 addresses need disambiguation within a sheet and 15 needs disambiguation across sheets. Disambiguation within a sheet, however, is usually not a critical issue because, under the block-based, instead of street-based, Japanese address system, it usually means multiple neighboring blocks. Future work includes georeferencing coordinates between old maps and the present map, and analyzing relationship between the geographic distribution of businesses and human activities in the urban space.Table 1: Matching 1034 unique addresses in the shopping guide against place names in the gazetteer.

For example, previous research has shown that characters with high network centrality typically perform the majority of speech acts and appear in most of the scenes (Fischer, Trilcke, Kittel, Milling, & Skorinkin, 2018). However, one can extract character networks from plays in various ways: Close reading may omit minor characters like attendants or servants, e.g., (Moretti, 2011), while distant reading (e.g., parsing an XML file) may include aggregate characters like “All”, “Both Lords”, or similar. Furthermore, the networks may display either implicit or explicit connections, depending on whether we connect characters because they appear in the same scene or because they are directly addressing each other, respectively. Thus, as adding more characters or connections to the network affects centralities and other network measures, the interpretation of both qualitative and quantitative aspects of characternetworks depends on the extraction method. In this work we are concerned with the specific question whether details of the textual source and the extraction method, such as adding minor or aggregate characters, make the main characters less “central”. A negative answer to this question would provide us with a further evidence for the validity of automated literary network analysis.ApproachWe analyse six versions of the character network of Shakespeare’s “Hamlet”. All networks were extracted via close or distant reading from different XML or text sources and analysed with NetworkX (Python). For each network, we compute four different centrality measures (closeness, betweenness, degree, and eigenvector centrality). Subsequently, for each centrality measure, we rank the 26 characters common in all networks and compare character ranks in different networks by computing their Spearman rank correlation. Basic statistics of the character networks. Observations, Conclusion, and Outlook. The networks including implicit connections are denser than those with only explicit connections. This yields different centrality ranks including the most important characters. For example, Horatio has many more implicit connections and connections to minor characters, which makes him the character with the highest degree centrality in the Haworth network. In the Moretti network, which contains only explicit connections, Hamlet has the highest degree centrality. Degree centralities for the Haworth (implicit connections, distant reading) and Moretti (explicit connections, close reading) networksDespite such individual differences, the groups of main characters derived from different networks exhibit relatively stable rankings, cf. (Fischer, Trilcke, Kittel, Milling, & Skorinkin, 2018). In contrast, rankings for minor characters tend to differ significantly. Therefore, for detecting the group of main characters, the details of the network extraction method do not have a significant effect, at least in the datasets we consider. In future work we aim to validate the generality of this claim by considering larger corpora of dramatic plays. Heatmaps depicting the rank correlation between closeness centralities derived fromdifferent networks for all, the 10 most important, and the 10 least important charactersFinally, we outline some further observations about different centrality measures: In our datasets, degree centrality is the most robust, exhibiting high rank correlation for all considered sets of characters. In contrast, eigenvector centrality has the widest range of rank correlations suggesting its high sensitivity with respect to the network structure.AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge permissions to use material from Martin Grandjean and Roger Haworth.

The sequential and hierarchical aspects of humanities data are often not the most important or interesting aspects. We’ve been exhorted to embrace the nonscalability and diversity of our data (Rawson and Muñoz), to disavow binary distinctions (D’Ignazio and Klein), and others are working to improve how we visualize uncertainty (Hullman). Creative and evocative visualizations abound, but they are rarely generalizable new approaches. Where are the new data visualizations for Digital Humanities work?  Based on work for a recent Princeton Prosody Archive (PPA) Editorial essay, I will share my experiences and failures attempting to visualize the seven scholar-curated collections within PPA. Categorization of the content in PPA is complicated because of the shifting meaning of the term prosody over time, encompassing both grammar and phonology as well as versification (Martin), and my visualizations reflect aspects of these two overlapping discourses in the form of the Linguistic and Literary collections within PPA.The seemingly simple task of showing the relative size and overlap of all seven collections is actually quite difficult. A bubble plot or bar chart can convey relative sizes, but can’t communicate overlaps and are limited to sets of similar scale. Visualizing the relative size and overlap of PPA (4,792 items) alongside the original bibliography that inspired its creation is useful, but put in context of all of HathiTrust (16 million items) we see a laughable diagram that nevertheless demonstrates the value of smaller, scholar-curated bibliographies (more than mere collections) based on HathiTrust materials. Relative sizes of bar charts are easier to read than circles, but a bar chart requires imposing an order. Euler and Venn diagrams (invented by mathematicians in the 1700s and 1800s) seem promising, but are limited in the number of sets, and also have the same problems with relative scale as bubble plots and bar charts. Treemap diagrams are useful for visualizing relationships, but only within a single hierarchy; likely because it was invented to visualize disk space utilization (Shneiderman and Plaisant). The UpSet plot is a relatively new solution to show “set intersections in a matrix layout” (Lex et al, 2014), which came out of bioinformatics, and is a powerful solution for this problem once viewers are oriented and trained to read an UpSet plot. Length proportional linear diagrams are another solution for set visualization (Rodgers et. al., 2015) which purport to improve set-related task performance, but they do not yet seem to be widely known or used. After a quick overview of these visualization solutions and their limitations, I will demonstrate an experimental visualization I created as I worked on visualizing the PPA collections. It was inspired by the “warming stripes” climate change visualization (Hawkins) and a workshop series on p5.js called “Playing with Data” (Roth and Koeser). Vertical stripes are used to represent each item, with colored horizontal rows designating collection membership; interaction allows the viewer to focus on a single collection and see how it overlaps with others. In an earlier prototype, I sorted items somewhat arbitrarily by publication date. In my most recent prototype, items are ordered randomly to give viewers an overall sense of the distribution of the collections, but with interaction that allows a user to group all items in a single collection to allow focusing on overlaps with one collection at a time. Some might argue that a linear diagram would provide a more objective or efficient solution, but I’m less interested in viewers “accomplishing set-based task performance” than I am in the affective and aesthetic impacts (D’Ignazio and Klein) that make it possible to see and interact with these collections.",rebecca.s.koeser@princeton.edu,Short Presentation

The first is an inductive method extracting implicit entities and meaning from textual (and sometimes visual) content. With the help of AI or manually compiled (existing) lists of entities, the entities are converted into information. The second, that Colavizza (2019) calls referential information systems, takes existing reference systems (like archival indexes) and uses them to contextualize individual documents. Both methods are used to turn corpora into computer accessible information systems. Ideally a more complete information system would result from combining both approaches, but in practice they are hard to bridge because of a number of different problems. This paper presents an approach that addresses those problems and combines inductive methods of automated text analysis and information extraction techniques with knowledge of the referential information systems to add rich semantic layers of information to large historical corpora.Making large historical corpora accessible for research usually involves a pipeline of processing steps, ranging from text recognition to entity and event spotting, disambiguation, identification and ideally contextualization (Meroño-Peñuela et al. 2015). In many projects much effort is spent on producing a close-to-perfect text by transcribing, or by a mixed procedure of automatic transcription by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and manual correction of the results, as many of the later elements in the pipeline require high-quality text to work well. There are ways to partially solve OCR or HTR (Handwritten Text Recognition) errors automatically through post-correction (see e.g. Reynaert 2014, Reynaert 2016), or to use word embeddings to overcome matching problems, (e.g. Egense 2017). The most important limitation of this approach is that full-text alone is not enough to make a corpus available for research that is not primarily directed at the text but rather at its information (Hoekstra and Koolen 2018, Upward 2018). Extracting and contextualizing information has many issues such as OCR and HTR errors that make it difficult to use standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like Named Entity Recognition (NER), topic modelling, Part Of Speech (POS) tagging and sentiment analysis, which has been common knowledge for a long time (Lopresti 2008, Traub et al. 2015, Mutuvi et al. 2018, Hill & Hengchen 2019, van Strien et al. 2020). However, solutions for such issues are scarce and badly documented, as argued by, amongst others, Piersma and Ribbens (2013), van Eijnatten et al. (2013) and Leemans et al. (2017).Many archives and libraries have experimented with giving access to their collections by means of their digitized inventories and some have gone a step further, using existing indexes of serial collections (Jeurgens 2016, Colavizza 2019, Head 2003). But these archival referential systems are too coarse for access beyond the document level. However, the existing scholarly apparatus consists of many more reference systems and tools that can be put to good use. Centuries of dealing with these complications have led to a number of convenient and often-employed structures that are part of the printed culture but are often ignored in the translation to digital access (Upward 2018, Opitz 2018).Exploiting Referential Information Systems and Repetitive PhrasesInstead of trying to find latent semantic structures through full-text analysis, these explicit structures allow for finding intended semantic information that is likely not available in another form. Remarkably, many digitization programmes take no advantage of these structures and sometimes do not even digitize them, extracting only the main textual body as plain text.A concrete and relatively simple example, the Resolutions of the Dutch States General is a collection of all resolutions (decisions) of the Dutch Republic from 1576 until 1796 and contains around 440,000 pages. Roughly half of the pages, up to 1703, are handwritten. From 1703 onwards, the States General printed yearly editions for easier access to previous resolutions. The States General met six days a week and kept a list of who was present on what date, followed by a summary of each resolution.

Although this art form can be ignored or go unnoticed (Veyne, 1988), recent events have led to many interactions with it. On the one hand, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought attention to the subject of access to culture. Due to confinement and imposed social distancing measures, citizens rediscovered their urban settings and thus renewed their interest for public art. On the other hand, the Black Lives Matter movement has revived debates over which artworks should be publicly displayed. The statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol is a historical symbol of white dominant colonial history. Far from an act of gratuitous “vandalism,” its toppling by protesters can rather be understood as an outcry of citizens whose voices have not been listened to. They therefore took matters into their own hands and, as a result, took part in the curation of their city’s public art collection. The destruction of art is recurrent in history, and its motives range from political upheavals to a variety of misunderstandings (Gamboni, 2007). Yet, even when confronted with such “monumental controversies” (Senie, 2019), decisions and discourses about public art are mostly generated by local government officers, politicians, cultural workers, or journalists. Although citizens are sometimes invited to be part of public art commissions, they usually lack the opportunity to voice their opinion. They are considered to be the recipients of public art policies whose aims are to elevate their culture and spirit.This top-down approach attributes a passive role to spectators, and such conception permeates onto the tools that promote public art. Our research into contemporary mobile applications dedicated to this art form reveals that most apps provide limited interactivity. They are digital equivalents of traditional guidebooks, enhanced with geolocation and audio-guides (Chicago Public Art, 2015, Otocast, 2019). More responsive, the ARTsansRDV app (Geneva, Switzerland, 2015) adapts the audio content to the user’s location. Nevertheless, these digital tools provide selected information. They instruct users on how to perceive the artworks from the perspective of cultural elites, leaving little room for individual perception and interpretation. This one-sided approach explains the lack of participatory features. The AtlasMuseum’s app (now deprecated) invited to greater involvement as the project aims to make an inventory of public artworks through crowdsourcing (Pringuet, 2017). However, this active stance requires previous knowledge and focuses on informative documentation.The underlying goal of these institutions has been to remove the geographical and financial divide, and thus democratize access to art (Donnat and Tolila, 2003: 8). However, even after “extracting culture from its symbolic and architectural shell” (Ghebaur, 2013: 709), interacting with it remains difficult. Whether it is in the choice of what is represented or in the way one should understand it, citizens are subjected to a sort of “institutional tyranny.” The MONA app was created to rethink public art, as a reminder to define it not only through location or funding, but also as a common property. Its name derives from a pun, with mon (my, the possessive pronoun) placed in front of the letter “a” for art and app alike. The app has two main goals. It confers citizens the right to have their own interpretation of public artworks. It also symbolically grants each individual their share of responsibility and accountability in their artistic environment.This free and open source app aligns basic smartphone functionalities with art discovery through gamification, personalization, and imagination. Each artwork is mapped and users are invited to search for them as in a life-sized treasure hunt. Once discovered, they interact with the art via mobile photography. They capture their own perspective of the artwork, voice their opinion through a short comment and produce a rating of their experience. Each discovery adds to their personal collection, which becomes over time a catalog illustrated by their own photographs. As the collection expands, the user receives badges as a reward and encouragement to pursue their exploration. No previous artistic knowledge is required as the app accompanies users in their discoveries, observations and interpretations of the artworks. Conversely, group activities (temporarily online) are organized to help those less confortable with the use of technologies to apprehend the workings of the app.Fig.1Fostering the emergence of the public's opinions has a civil and an academic purpose. The photographs, comments, and ratings provided by the users are collected anonymously on university servers (under our privacy policy). These will allow us to study, for the first time, how people see, feel and think about public art. Research and publications derived from the app aim to share these responses, giving authority to the participation of citizens. Now more than ever, people express an active interest in the historical and cultural representations that shape their city’s image and identities. MONA users are therefore encouraged to participate in sharing their discoveries and opinions on social media. All ─ including artists, historians and political figures, but also families, local dog-walkers and curious teenagers ─ get to share their thoughts on historical figures commemorated in their neighbourhood parks. This is a particularly vivid example for the MONA team since the nearest artwork from our headquarters is the bust of Christopher Columbus (Armand De Palma, 1976, Montreal’s public art collection). Altogether, such bottom-up structure creates opportunities to hear from a diversity of people, which is not only valuable for our society but also provides a unique and innovative research field.Our singular take on public art is the result of a practical, ""real-life"" approach that corresponds to DH methods for a knowledge base grounded in making and experimentation (Burdick et al. 2012: 57). The app's metadata is provided by Montréal and Québec's open data platforms. The iOS and Android apps are each developed in the native languages, Swift and Java respectively, in order to meet industry standards and user expectations. First prototyped in the class room, MONA has become a collaborative project uniting students in art history, computer science, design, and more. Combining a research project (Art+site) with the work of a non-profit organisation (La Maison MONA), we offer new approaches to the study of public art while also encouraging rich and critical exchanges between all citizens. As digital alternatives flourish in the cultural field, we endeavour to offer physical access to culture and to use the digital realm to create a space of expression for new and unheard voices. Each contribution makes it a little more our art, aiming to bridge social and cultural divides by taking into account our society’s diversity and complexity.",lena.krause@umontreal.ca,Lightning

The insights gained should help those involved in the education of humanities scholars with various levels of technical capabilities, as well as technical experts with and/or without the understanding of humanities research to develop better training programmes. To this end we invite (i) submissions by pairs (or teams) consisting of members with different skill sets, as well as (ii) submissions by educators with experience in cross-discipline training. An invited talk at the beginning and a round table discussion at the end will complete the program. Please note that the chosen workshop format with the open call for submissions is in line with common practice in many sub-disciplines of Digital Humanities, and serves to attract contributions from a wide range of disciplines and sub-disciplines of Digital Humanities in a broad sense, including Social Sciences and Cultural Heritage Studies.Background:Research in the Humanities in a very broad sense (including Cultural Heritage Studies and Social Sciences) can only truly benefit from new developments in technology if researchers and professionals with different capabilities team up. This situation is very similar to the hard sciences, where research is done in teams working on a specific problem, where everybody brings in his/her specific content and technical expertise and skills. Co-design, co-development and co-creation are the rule rather than the exception, and the proposers want to investigate how this could be facilitated in the disciplines mentioned above. In the rest of this proposal we will use the term humanities in the broad sense described above, and digital humanities to refer to humanities research using digital data and tools.The proposed workshop is a follow-up of the first, successful TwinTalks workshop that took place on March 5 2019 at the Nordic DH conference in Copenhagen, and the second TwinTalks workshop to take place at the Nordic DH conference in Riga planned for March 2020, now postponed to October. Whereas in the first workshop the focus was on analysing what happened on the work floor from the perspective of the researchers, and on identifying possible obstacles for collaboration, in the follow-up workshops we have added a new perspective: that of the humanities or digital humanities educator who has experience in bridging the gap between humanities and technical skills. The programme will reflect this.Objectives:The main objective of the proposed workshop is to get a better understanding of the dynamics on the Digital Humanities work floor when researchers and professionals with different areas of competence work in tandem to solve humanities research questions, and to explore how education and training of both humanities scholars and technical experts can help making collaboration across disciplines more efficient, effective and (where possible) more creative and innovative. What does it mean to pose a research question in the humanities that is technically tractable and how does it change our understanding of interpretative work? Conversely, is there room for creativity in the application of technical tools and what are the limitations? How can we ensure that have the same understanding of the research question to be answered and of the technical (im)possibilities?The insights gained should help those involved in the education of humanities scholars, professionals and technical experts alike to develop better training programmes, tailored towards the needs of a diverse group of potential learners.Audience: Researchers, professionals, educators, and Research Infrastructure operators with a special interest in creating the conditions where people with humanities research skills and technical expertise (or both) can fruitfully collaborate in answering humanities research questions.Originally proposed format (pre-COVID-19):The programme starts with an invited talk by a prominent speaker, which will set the scene for the rest of the day.The main component of the workshop programme consists of two types of (submitted) talks:Twin talks, i.e. talks presented by pairs consisting of someone rooted primarily in humanities research (with a humanities research problem, i.e. not a technical problem or tool) and someone with a more technical background who has contributed technical capabilities to arrive at the answers. Talks consist of three parts, followed by questions from the audience. In the first part the humanities research question is the point of focus, while in the second part the technical aspects of the research are highlighted. In the third part these perspectives come together, as the team describes how the collaboration went, including obstacles that were encountered, and how better training and education could help to make collaboration more efficient and effective.Teach talks, i.e. talks by people with experience or interesting ideas about how cross-discipline collaboration is or can be addressed in curricula or other training activities.The final component of the programme, which makes the event a workshop rather than a mini-conference, is a round table discussion between speakers, invited experts and the audience to discuss and analyse the findings of the talks, and to formulate conclusions and recommendations for developing better training programmes.Revised format:Due to the coronavirus the DH2020 conference will go virtual, and so will the TwinTalks 3 workshop. This has consequences for the format.The duration of the virtual workshop will be 2 hours, and it will have an interactive, panel-like format, with short pitches (duration dependent on number of accepted talks). The Twin Talk pitches should briefly describe (i) the research problem addressed, (ii) its solution, including the technical aspects, (iii) a report on the collaboration experience itself, including obstacles encountered and (iv) recommendations how better training and education could help to make collaboration more efficient and effective.The Teach Talks should briefly describe (i) the collaboration settings on which they are based, (ii) the approach adopted, and (iii) recommendations.After the talks there will be a discussion with all participants to formulate the lessons learned from the presentations, and to identify further steps that could be taken.Reading material and expected learning outcomes:The workshop is a follow-up to a successful first Twin Talks workshop at DHN2019 in Copenhagen and a workshop to take place at DNH2020 in Riga (moved to October 2020), where the scene for the discussion of this topic was set.Reading material:Participants are requested to read the proceedings of the DHN2019 workshop and Mikko Tolonen’s invited talk at this workshop “Why humanities research questions should come first? Reflections on different kinds of collaboration in digital history.” Learning outcomes:Recommendations for university and other curricula, and for strategies to disseminate them.","steven@clarin.eu, darja.fiser@ff.uni-lj.si",Workshop/Tutorial 4

Academic libraries are important discipline-spanning partners in the digital humanities, from research to teaching. DH library staff engage in a broad range of pedagogic activities, including teaching for-credit classes, partnering with teaching faculty in their classrooms, and offering workshops, to name a few. These sites of learning offer possibilities for social justice pedagogy across a spectrum of pedagogic praxis. This panel will explore a range of approaches DH librarians and staff across the United States employ for social justice pedagogy, representing a range of institutions from research universities to liberal arts colleges. We will examine ways of infusing critical pedagogy into DH library instruction, including one-shot instruction and embedded librarianship, as well as DH instruction designed specifically for classes related to social justice. We will cover varying approaches to building academic communities based on collaboration, kindness, generosity, and shared values, and we will discuss user-centered DH teaching and learning that is inclusive and responsive to particular student needs. We will also contemplate the perils and possibilities of engaging in DH and social justice work within and beyond libraries. Libraries are an important site to examine the intersections of DH, social justice, and pedagogy, and we hope this panel will offer multiple windows into the on-going work in this area and move forward both the conversation and the practice around the way we engage with DH learners.Pamella R. Lach, Digital Humanities Librarian, San Diego State University. “Infusing Critical Digital Humanities Pedagogy in the Library Classroom: From One-Shot Instruction to Embedded Librarianship”Digital Humanities librarians engage in a range of DH-related instruction, from the “one-shot”—a single and standalone interaction with a class—to embedded librarianship—in which a librarian works closely with a class for the duration of a semester. Librarians striving to infuse critical digital humanities approaches into classrooms that are not their own must be prepared to incorporate critical approaches in both small and large ways. This talk explores the opportunities and challenges for one DH librarian attempting to infuse critical digital humanities into their instruction.Often faced with a limited amount of time with students, I carefully select DH project examples that have a social justice focus, whether a digital history project that serves as a corrective to the archival silencing of people of color, or a project explicitly designed to advance equity, diversity, inclusion (EDI), and social justice through its digital praxis. I also ask students to explore well-intentioned projects that fall short of these goals—for example, projects that re-objectify and dehumanize individuals through problematic visual representations. In examining a range of projects dedicated to people of color—their histories and stories—my students and I engage in critical sensemaking that interrogates the motivations of the projects’ creators, the assumptions and biases baked into the projects, and the unintended messages being delivered. While I cannot always provide solutions to these problems, the questioning that we engage in together leads to a critical praxis that I hope they will apply to other classes and scholarship (digital or analog).More often than not, I work closely with classes over an entire semester in a more embedded style, which affords me opportunities for even greater social justice interventions.When engaging in ongoing work with a class—whether project- or tools-based—I bring in that same critical framework. But my obligation towards critical DH extends beyond the examples I use to teach or the conversations we have in class. Working at a lesser-resourced, teaching-intensive institution where not all students own a laptop or are comfortable with technology, I often select free, lower-tech solutions with minimal access barriers. But in selecting such tools, many of which rely on Google integration, I am also aware of the risks to the students, particularly for undocumented students who might be vulnerable using tools that do not guarantee data privacy or expose them to surveillance risks. While opting for expensive tools may not necessarily be the solution, I try to make these choices transparent, call attention to the risks, and offer meaningful alternatives and opt-out solutions so that students can make informed decisions about how they want to engage in DH in their classes.Even when we are not instructors of record, DH librarians can make important contributions to the classroom by modeling critical inquiry and helping students evaluate digital scholarship from an EDI- and social justice-informed lens. Whether they are reviewing existing digital projects or creating their own, we can teach students to make careful—if constrained—choices, and to be open and honest about those choices.Megan Martinsen, Digital Scholarship Librarian, Georgetown University. “Digital Humanities Methods for Social Justice Pedagogy”The growing discussion about infusing digital humanities pedagogy with social justice concepts is incredibly important work and exciting to see. Less discussed, but equally exciting in my view, is the reverse. Embedding digital humanities tools and methods into social justice pedagogy is a useful and important endeavor. It can open up avenues for social justice students to share their important work online as public scholars and as students gain comfort with digital research methods, they can potentially ask new questions about the social justice topics they study.My talk will present a case study of a social justice course at my institution where I collaborated with the teaching faculty member to create a final project that used digital humanities methods and where I served as an embedded librarian for the semester. The course, Justice and Peace Studies 299, is the research methods course required for the Justice and Peace Studies major and minor. The bulk of the course is spent exploring research methods used in social justice studies. My collaboration with the teaching faculty member added a section on digital humanities methods that can be applied to social justice studies.The assignment we created had students work in groups focused on a social justice issue of their choosing. Each group was required to write a paper that employed basic text mining, create an infographic, create a data visualization, and create a map. My talk will delve into how the assignment came to be, student reactions to the assignment, and common issues the student groups faced. And I’ll discuss lessons learned from the project and how we might change and shift the project in upcoming semesters.While not every institution has a social justice degree path, they are growing in popularity and many institutions now offer at least some coursework in social justice studies. My hope is that this talk will help digital humanities practitioners see a role for themselves as collaborators with these emergent programs.Brandon Walsh, Scholars’ Lab Head of Student Programs, University of Virginia Library; Amanda Visconti, Scholars’ Lab Managing Director, University of Virginia Library. “Building Community and Generosity in the Context of Graduate Education”The academy trains students in complex intellectual work and tends to reward the performance of one’s own intelligence, both in coursework and in conferences. But in collaborative digital projects, this sort of focus on the individual is detrimental to the group dynamic, which must take shape around more than just the individual. In our year-long introduction to digital humanities by way of project-based pedagogy, we consistently noted this tension in our fellowship cohorts. Each year, we struggled to promote healthy collaboration centered on shared buy-in and generosity; our students instead remained focused on what a group project would mean for them and their careers. While these are important needs and understandable desires, we hoped to use their year with us as an opportunity for them to grow beyond this framing. We eventually realized that our problem was expecting the students to act in a way different than habitually expected and taught in other parts of the academy. We realized this was a matter of training: our students were trained in seminar-type environments that value the performance of individual thought, and never were exposed to or rewarded for a different approach. This talk discusses workshops and exercises for our graduate student fellows that encourage reorienting their collaborative practices away from a focus on the self, and towards creating more generous and kind community spaces. We will focus on a workshop on community and collaboration we now teach for our students, where we discuss what might be gained by de-centering yourself, building up rather than deconstructing, leading from trust and kindness, and more. This session is part of a larger exercise in producing group statements of values—charters—that require students to examine their own personal goals, experiences, and backgrounds in relationship to the whole. This process tries to help students recognize that these conversations deserve a space in academic discourse, that academic practice can be different than they’ve experienced elsewhere, and that this conversation can be a space in which to begin to shape a different kind of scholarly work.Heather Froehlich, Literary Informatics Librarian, Penn State University. “Digital Pedagogy at Scale: Reaching Different Student Populations” How we adapt classroom pedagogy based on the needs of a given student population is a common discussion in instruction and pedagogy circles. However, this has been less of a discussion in Digital Humanities instruction: the assumption seems to be primarily focused on a specific population signed up for a class with a DH element. But what happens when your institutional population covers a range of students and socioeconomic backgrounds across a wide range of the state’s demographics? In this talk I will discuss some practical considerations about teaching digital methods across a multi-campus state university system using two examples of digital humanities instruction related to early modern digital projects. One project at a well-resourced flagship campus involving a graduate seminar in scholarly editing where students are learning about digital scholarly editing with TEI; the associated undergraduate class is learning to flex their muscles in a lower-stakes editing task. The other project, at one of our 4-year undergraduate, more residential colleges is an exercise in undergraduate student research related to 17th century recipe books; students transcribe and are developing research projects around this manuscript.In each situation, the pedagogical contexts are wildly different: at one campus, our students are widely understood to be from more upper middle-class families and often have a parent or family member who went to college; at another campus, our students are primarily local and a significant population are 1st-generation and/or coming in via local, urban community colleges. Our graduate students represent a third vector, given that they all have undergraduate degrees and many of them are in a combined MA-PhD program. Developing models of instruction for these classes require a level of flexibility for the librarian and faculty partners: what works for one group does not always work for all others.R.C. Miessler, Systems Librarian, Gettysburg College. “Values-Based Communities of Practice in the Digital Humanities”The Digital Scholarship Summer Fellowship is a library-led, high-impact learning experience for undergraduates at a liberal arts college that provides students an introduction to Digital Humanities tools and methods. Student fellows receive a stipend for the summer to participate in the program, in which they choose their own research question and create a digital project. While the students’ research topics may or may not share themes, tools, or methods during the course of the summer program, all fellows participate in a common curriculum, read and discuss a variety of readings from a diverse range of DH practitioners, and publicly present their projects at the end of the summer. The librarian facilitators of the program draw from their own areas of expertise or interest to mentor students, deliver workshops, and guide discussions. Together, both students and librarians broaden their own understanding of the nature and workings of DH in a space that encourages experimentation and failure.The core experience of the summer program is the emphasis on the development of a community of practice amongst the student cohort and librarian facilitators; rather than focusing on a single research question or method, the community is centered on shared values. To support a wide range of research questions, the librarians who facilitate the fellowship approach Digital Humanities pedagogy from a generalist and discipline-agnostic perspective when teaching tools and methods. With each student fellow undertaking an independent research project, workshops focus on critical evaluation of the affordances and limitations of the Digital Humanities more broadly, as well as introducing students to project management, user experience, and public speaking. Through the framework of the curriculum, students have agency to choose which tools and methods are best suited to their research while acknowledging the limitations of what they can reasonably accomplish in the course of the summer program.This talk will focus on the evolution of the development of local, values-based DH communities of practice that transcend typical administrator/undergraduate hierarchies and how those values are transmitted and reinforced via experimentation, mentorship, and pedagogy. Past student projects created during the summer programs that have focused on the local community and issues of social justice will also be highlighted to show how the values have carried on in student research activity.Nabil Kashyap, Digital Scholarship Librarian, Swarthmore College. “Institutional Tactics: Locating Social Justice in Liberal Arts DH”Drawing on a breadth of library activities at a liberal arts college, this talk explores how our campus has engaged highly elusive, tangled issues around digital humanities pedagogy and social justice. The questions that animate our work: Where can we find and make space in our professional practices to address injustice? How can we make that work legible and articulate value when it takes place diffusely across a range of decisions, sites, and stakeholders? Given our context, how can we avoid being subsumed by trends in higher education and resist institutional virtue signaling?We examine three loci of recent activity: faculty pedagogy, student programs, and ad hoc collaboration. We regularly design and lead workshops aimed at instructors around digital assignments and implementing DH tools in the classroom. The resulting skills intensives have taken place both at liberal arts colleges and larger campuses. This process affords us opportunities to explicitly engage the perils and possibilities of digital assignments and platforms--from the violence of metadata to military/colonial histories of particular tools to minimal web development for decentralized, public humanities.We run several co-curricular student programs including a digital scholarship student initiative that brings humanities and computer science majors together around theory and praxis of digital environments. We read widely in STS, Post-Colonial DH, and media theory, while working hands-on with the web stack, attentive to the ecological, political, and social dimensions of everyday digital infrastructure.We also have regular opportunities to collaborate with other units on campus. How might we, for example, partner with initiatives oriented around innovation and entrepreneurship? One way was to co-sponsored a hackathon, which allowed us to shape the structure and goals of event. Through that process we were able to eschew commercial webapps in favor of partnering with local activist organizations representing pressing community needs.Rather than showcasing disparate library initiatives, these activities taken in aggregate point to the library as a site for contingent tactics deployed alongside institutional strategies. We engage in flexible if fallible approaches to our professional and personal commitments to social justice as enacted through and imperiled by digital environments.","plach@sdsu.edu, megan.martinsen@georgetown.edu, visconti@virginia.edu, walsh@virginia.edu, hgf5@psu.edu, rmiessle@gettysburg.edu, nkashya1@swarthmore.edu",Panel

Following the 2019 workshop which focused on the use of time series as a way to understand and visualize humanities data, the 2020 workshop is dedicated to how network exploration and analysis can be similarly used to understand and visualize. The questions that focus the workshop are: How can network visualisations provide a distant viewing of data? What are the different steps to build a network? How to read it? Similar to 2019, the workshop will begin with an introduction to culture analytics and network analysis offered as a framework for the rest of the workshop. Afterwards, there will be two brief presentations of of research examples, one involving a small dataset and another one with big data. This will be followed by a hands-on tutorial with Gephi that will introduce participants to the basics of network exploration and analysis. Gephi is a popular network visualization and analysis tool.

Six years later, scholarship by James F. English, Allison Hegel, Andrew Piper & Richard Jean So, Dan Sinykin, and Jordan Sellers & Ted Underwood (among others) has shown the range of insights that can be drawn from a corpus of book reviews and/or sets of book review corpora. Simultaneously, prominent voices in digital humanities have called on the scholarly community “to consider the nature of ontological gaps and epistemological biases,” including the “infrastructures of knowledge-making” on which large scale, computational studies often depend. This panel will present four papers at the forefront of cultural analytics methods and analysis of book reviews.In “Modeling Bibliographical Information in Historic Book Reviews: Large Scale Applications with Proquest’s American Periodicals Series,” Matthew J. Lavin evaluates computational methods to classify items as likely book reviews, differentiate single-work reviews from multi-work reviews, and extract from reviews information about the book and author being reviewed.“Book Reviews and the Consolidation of Genre” (Kent Chang, Yuerong Hu, Wenyi Shang, Aniruddha Sharma, Shubhangi Singhal, Ted Underwood, Jessica Witte, Peizhen Wu) addresses a common doubt about the significance of text analysis by showing that measurements of similarity between literary texts correlate with similarities between their reviews. It then uses this method to trace the consolidation of genre.In “Reconstructing Consecration in US Literary History, 1965-2000,” Dan Sinykin uses social network analysis methods on book reviews to evaluate novels’ centrality in a network. It analyzes the publishers most or least likely to offer an author literary success, the impact of gender and race on reception, and the changing literary value of genre.In “The Crowdsourced ‘Classics’ and the Revealing Limits of Goodreads Data,” Melanie Walsh and Maria Antoniak analyze more than 100,000 Goodreads reviews of the most popular “classics” in order to reveal the widespread use of “classic” as a colloquial literary critical term that is related to but distinct from the “canon.” Through the lens of these reviews, the authors investigate how online readers and institutions both old and new collaboratively construct the highly lucrative category of the “classics.”Collectively, these four papers offer new perspectives on corpus development, modeling the book review as an object of study, and analyzing large sets of book reviews using natural language processing, machine learning, and social network analysis methods.","lavin@pitt.edu, kentkaihsiungchang@gmail.com, yuerong2@illinois.edu, wenyis3@illinois.edu, ashar29@illinois.edu, shubhangi1722@gmail.com, tunder@illinois.edu, jcwitte2@illinois.edu, peizhen4@illinois.edu, daniel.sinykin@emory.edu, melanie.walsh@cornell.edu, maa343@cornell.edu",Panel

One research methodology, which was developed for lexicometry and text statistical analysis, is Textometry. I.e., the attempt to combine various statistical analysis techniques, such as factorial correspondence analysis (Benzécri, 1977) and hierarchical ascendant classification (Ward Jr, 1963), with full-text search techniques such as kwic concordances (Luhn, 1960), in order to trace the precise original editorial context of any textual event participating to the analysis.The TXM software (Heiden, 2010), which was developed in France as a modular platform of a new generation of textometrical research and which I adapted to Hebrew, gives the ability to analyze a large corpus of texts as in my research, by using tools and methods based on linguistics and discourse analysis, that is, decomposing the text into factors and elements, carrying out statistical analysis, identifying the hidden social patterns, and then restoring the corpus to its original mode.As a Ph.D. student in the discipline of Social Sciences, my research focuses on the image repair theory (Benoit, 2015) as an ensemble of strategies such as evading responsibility and reducing offensiveness, used by individuals, organizations and groups in order to repair their image during times of crisis. It examines the ways in which rhetorical measures are used in online verbal exchanges among users of the online social networks who attempt to repair their personal image. To achieve my goal, I use the TXM software to analyze a corpus of more than eight million words in 365 Facebook posts, which were published by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his current affairs, and more than 285,000 comments, made by the users. Netanyahu's Affairs are four police investigations in which he is involved as a suspect or has given a testimony.During the poster session, I will present a review of some tools I used with the TXM software during the digitized analysis process in my Ph.D. research and the way they allowed me to recognize the following key phrase used by Netanyahu: ""They have the media, we have you"". Among these tools are Progression, which is the frequency of occurrence of one term throughout the text corpus; Co-occurrence, which is the frequency of occurrence of two terms in a text corpus alongside each other in a certain order; and Specificity, which is the score a term is given based on its occurrence in the corresponding part of the corpus relative to the one in the entire corpus, and indicates whether it is overused, underused or useless.",maximlengo@gmail.com,Poster

If the constraints can be satisfied, then the program will output all possible orderings of events that are consistent with the constraints. Instead of using computers to identify a unique ‘correct’ interpretation, this paper attempts to model the space of contested meanings within the text.

Creating digital texts of the original documents either by optical record recognition or by human typists is required for employing digital assistance in Digital Humanities. The original Chinese texts usually did not include delimiters between words and sentences. Figure 1 shows a tomb biography that Liu and Chang used for discussing sentence segmentation of classical Chinese. Unlike English, Chinese words are not separated by spaces, and there are no punctuation marks in the source texts. Word segmentation and sentence segmentation are thus important bedrocks for algorithmic understanding of classical Chinese, and the literature in digital humanities has started to see relevant discussions. Researchers applied statistical, machine-learning, or deep-learning methods to train computational models for the segmentation tasks. Figure 1: A sample tomb biography in classical ChineseIn standard machine-learning approaches, researchers acquire a collection of corpora for training and test purposes. Over the past many years, many, though not all, documents and books that were written in classical Chinese have been manually typed and saved as computer files. Modern punctuation marks have been added to the files at the same time. It is thus relatively easier to use the annotated texts for sentence segmentation than for word segmentation because it is very rare, if any, for typists to mark word boundaries in digitized texts. The training sets in Wang et al.’s, Han et al.’s and Shi et al.’s works have 237, 44, and 50 million characters, respectively. Although we expect that using more training data should lead to better test results in general, this beneficial effect is not automatic. Due to the nature of machine-learning experiments, especially of deep-learning ones, it is not easy (or appropriate) to compare experimental results directly by their numbers. Various factors may influence the quality of segmentation. The best F1 measure observed in Wang et al.’s work is slightly better than 80%. When using a much larger training dataset for Qing, Han et al. did not report better results than when they used a much smaller dataset for the Tang epitaph. Shi et al. defined their own measure for quality, and observed that the quality of segmentation varied between mid 60% and mid 90% in experiments for data of different Chinese dynasties. Machine-learning based methods provide us effective ways to build a running system for sentence segmentation. When provided with sufficient data, we may train computational models for sentence segmentation, and achieve impressive results. Despite this convenience, previous research seldom aims at investigating the factors behind the success and perhaps failure of applications of deep-learning techniques for segmenting classical Chinese . Some pioneers had discussed the needs of explainable artificial intelligence as early as 2004, and the demands are strengthening in recent years. The quest for explanation not only satisfies our curiosity but also helps us build better systems for the segmentation tasks.We may design different procedures to train computation models for sentence segmentation and observe the differences in the resulting quality of segmentation. The differences in the training procedures may provide clues as to what the computation models might learn from the training data. Though experimental findings alone are not solid proofs, the observations can be enlightening.The table in Figure 2 provides some basic statistics about the corpora that were used in our experiments. These corpora belonged to two genres and are representative documents of the Tang dynasty. MZM contains only tomb biographies, and OTB and NTB are historical documents. To make the experimental results comparable, we split each of these corpora, and used 70% and 30% of each for training and test purposes, respectively.Figure 2: Basic statistics of three corpora of classical Chinese (Tang dynasty)We adopt a typical deep learning procedure for marking sentence boundaries in these corpora. The corpora took turns to serve as training and test data. We produced the character embedding vectors of the corpora using Gensim, and trained deep neural networks that are comprised of five layers of BiLSTM units in Keras. We measured the quality of sentence segmentation with the F1 measure. The table in Figure 3 shows the observed F1 measures for part of a system of experiments. In the first experiment (ID=1), we used only MZM for training and test, and achieved 0.8772 in F1. In Experiment 31, we used MZM, OTB, and NTB for training the LSTMs to segment the test portion of MZM. With the help of the extra training data, the F1 increased slightly.Figure 3: Using different combinations of corpora to generate word vectors and train classifiersIn Experiment 47, we produced character embedding with MZM, OTB, and NTB, trained the LSTMs with OTB to segment OTB, and achieved a better F1 than that for Experiment 2. In Experiment 41, we added NTB to train the LSTMs, and improved the F1. In contrast, in Experiment 35, we observed a smaller improvement when we added MZM to train the LSTMs. One possible reason for the reduction in improvement is that OTB is more similar with NTB than with MZM.Another evidence for supporting this conjecture is that we achieved 0.7535 in Experiment 50 when we trained the LSTMs with NTB to segment OTB. When we used only MZM to train the LSTMs to segment OTB, the F1 was only 0.5695 in Experiment 44. When we do not train the LSTMs with OTB to segment OTB, we achieved much better results when training the LSTMs with a more related corpus.We have extended our work on sentence and word segmentation that were reported in DH2018 and DH2019. On the computing side, we have achieved better results by switching from traditional machine-learning methods to deep-learning techniques. As a study in Digital Humanities, we attempt to find qualitative explanations for the changing improvements which were influenced by the varying combinations of training data. We analyzed our observations based on results observed in a large number of experiments statistically. We could provide just one sample discussion for sentence segmentation tasks here, and we wish to have an opportunity to discuss more details about our experience in DH2020.

MZM is the complete contents of the two books of Tang Tomb Biographies (tang2 dai4 mu4 zhi4 hui4 bian1唐代墓誌彙編) and one book of sequel (tang2 dai4 mu4 zhi4 hui4 bian1 xu4 ji2唐代墓誌彙編續集). OTB contains the biographies (lie4 chuan4列傳) in the Old Tang Book (jiu4 tang2 shu1舊唐書), and NTB contains the biographies (lie4 chuan4列傳) in the New Tang Book (xin1 tang2 shu2新唐書). Tang is a Chinese dynasty that existed between 618CE and 907CE. Note that the step for word embedding and the step for training the LSTM units are separate. Gensim is available at https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/. When using word2vec to create the embedding vectors for Chinese characters, we set window (the window size) to 12, min_count to 1, batch_words to 8000, iter to 50, and produced vectors of 300 dimensions. We only report results of using the skip-gram algorithm. Keras is available at https://keras.io/. Inherited from our work that was reported in DH2019, we consider a context of six characters for determining whether a character is the last character of a sentence in training our BiLSTM stack. The outputs of the BiLSTM units have 400 dimensions, the optimizer is Adam, and we used softmax as the activation function for the final output layer. The output layer is a Dense layer, which used the categorical_crossentropy as the loss function.[18] In the table in Figure 3, M, O, and N denote MZM, OTB, and NTB in the table in Figure 2, respectively. The columns M, O, and N indicate whether the corpora were used in creating word-embedding vectors and whether the corpora were used in training the LSTM stack. To facilitate the comparisons, we used only one corpus in the tests. We showed results for part of our experiments, so there are missing IDs in the table in Figure 3.","chaolin@g.nccu.edu.tw, ericzx103703012@gmail.com, wz840427@gmail.com, ccs96307@gmail.com",Long Presentation

T. Lupker & Dr. William J. Turkel The availability of large musical datasets like the Million Song Dataset (Bertin-Mahieux et al 2011) has made it possible for researchers in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) to develop artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that perform a wide variety of musically-based tasks. In part, this is because algorithmically-determined characteristics of a song, including its key, mode, pitch, tempo and timbre, can be used to create labelled instances for training supervised learners like various kinds of neural nets. At the same time, the existence of these large datasets has made it possible for researchers to take a ‘big data’ approach to various styles of western music. One notable example is the work by Serrà et al (2012) which showed the changes and trends related to pitch transitions, the homogenization of the timbral palette and growing loudness levels that have shaped pop music over the past 60 years. The authors went on to suggest that past songs might be modernized into new hits by restricting pitch transitions, reducing timbral variety and making them louder. We believe that it is possible to make use of musical big data to develop new kinds of compositional tools that employ AI to aid in the creation of new music. Although there is certainly a tradition of using computers in composition, many tools that have been created without a grounding in musical theory have often failed to attract the attention of composers. Existing examples of AI that have been implemented in music composition have largely been directed toward autonomously generated music and not toward tools that might aid a composer (Briot et al., 2019). Here we present work-in-progress that attempts to bridge the gap between the big data approach, which is based on algorithmically determined physical properties of a song, and an approach grounded in strong musical theory. From the perspective of the music theorist and composer, a number of techniques that are common in the MIR literature do not always make much musical sense. We have been able to improve performance of mode and key detection algorithms, for example, simply by incorporating more musical knowledge into them. Our long-term goal is to determine how a series of AI algorithms trained to learn from pitch and timbre relationships according to mood, might aid and benefit a composer in the process of creating new music. What can the study of pitch transitions and timbral relationships offer the creation of new mood-based music compositions? The system that we will discuss uses a genetic algorithm trained on pitch and timbre relationships from a large dataset. Given a desired mood, the program makes suggestions on musical structuring, chord progressions, timbre options based on chord selections and even melodic segment suggestions given in real-time, akin to the “autocorrect” feature on smartphones. As each suggestion is offered by the program, the composer can select whether or not they like it, dislike it or feel neutral towards it, so the program can continue to learn from the composer with each iteration of the genetic algorithm.

Forty years after the end of the Cultural Revolution, with the intention to promote the public remembrance and discussion of this significant period of Chinese history, the East Asian Library at the University of Pittsburgh launched CR/10 (University of Pittsburgh, 2019), a digital oral history project that aims to collect and preserve authentic memories of the Cultural Revolution through 10-minute semi-structured interviews. Using the technique of snowball sampling for interviewee selection, the project has thus far collected more than 300 interviews with ordinary people from different generations, geographies, social and educational backgrounds who experienced the incident or learned about it from family, school, or other resources. Among all the interviewees, some currently live in the U.S. while some in China, whose everyday experiences post the Cultural Revolution may have exerted impacts on their individual memories. Most interviews were conducted in mandarin Chinese and were then translated into English as subtitles by the CR/10 team. All the interviews were video-recorded and made open-access on the interactive CR/10 website. The website consists of four major components: an introduction to the project, a trailer for the project that showcases interviews, a timeline and a map of China demonstrating the temporal and geographical distributions of the videos in the collection.In this paper, I treat the CR/10 website as the object of study and demonstrate its value as a digital public humanities site bridging the gap between the academy and the general public. Cox and Tilton (2019) defined the term “digital public humanities (DPH)” as practices that “facilitate reflection and collaboration with participants outside of the academy through digital theories and technologies” (p. 130). Focusing on interactive and mindful design (Drucker, 2013), the CR/10 website invites the public to participate in, as well as contributing to, developing a diversified and multifaceted understanding of the Cultural Revolution. In this study, I present a series of user experience research conducted regarding the design of the website with 15 users outside of the academy, to examine the current usability as well as to identify further design possibilities of the website. Through techniques of semi-structured contextual interviews and focus group study, this research study aims to reflect on the reception and use of the CR/10 website as an interactive teaching and learning platform, rather than solely a repository of collective memories or database of historical information. More specifically, I examine how the timeline and map features of the website enrich interpretations of the Cultural Revolution, especially in terms of inspiring users to reflect upon the following questions: How could the Cultural Revolution be defined? What factors (e.g., geography, generation, family, class backgrounds, and education) influence impressions and memories of the Cultural Revolution? Extending from the user experience research, this study also proposes recommendations to improve the design of the CR/10 website to create a collective “memory atlas” (Cornell University Library, 2013; Forster, 1976) out of the video collection. Findings of this study contribute to facilitating academy-public collaborations in building DPH sites from the user perspective and a design-mediated approach.",rom77@pitt.edu,Short Presentation

In order to depict the situations and actions of a narrative as well as to characterise its protagonists, ancient Greek artists made use of a broad variety of often similar image elements. The interaction and meaningful relationship of the protagonists is depicted with significant postures and gestures (schemata) in order to illustrate key aspects of the storyline. These schemes are not restricted to a certain iconography, so that visual links between different images occur. Being familiar with these relationships the ancient viewer could detect the specific narration and understand the meaning of the image. For example, the scheme of leading the bride in Attic vase paintings is characterised by a significant leading-gesture (χεῖρ’ ἐπὶ καρπῷ – hand on wrist / hand on hand) that relates bride and bridegroom in non-mythological wedding scenes, thereby expressing a hierarchy of the two figures in active or passive parts respectively. Both protagonists are connected in a communicative way defined by meaningful postures and gestures.Besides these descriptive schemes there are narrative elements, like the surrounding, specific attributes of gods or other objects, that contribute to the viewer’s understanding of narrative contexts. These other characteristic attributes are needed in order to determine the depiction as a specific mythological one. Scenes of Helen and Menelaos (dressed as warrior and threatening her with weapons), thus, make use of the leading the bride scheme to show that Menelaos leads Helen home from Troy, like a bride. Only by combining the formal schemes and narrative elements is it possible to determine the depiction as a certain mythological story and to understand its cultural meaning.We, therefore, need to recognize the narrative elements of the pictorial stories and to decode their formal key structures by comparing a high number of ancient images and by discovering visual similarities. It is necessary to target the understanding of complex semantic relationships and cultural references in a mixed-initiative-interaction between researcher and machine, and involve computer vision as a fourth Bildwissenschaft. We approach this problem using state-of-the-art object recognition algorithms in computer vision. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks which maps the attributes occurring in Classical Archaeology into a deep representational space, through deep learning techniques. This representation maps the inherent variations in the representation of any particular attribute into a common space. A further novel method is developed that uses this representation space along with the context of the narrative for a better understanding of the depicted scene in the artwork. We also analyse the model performance with abstract classes where we combine multiple similar attributes into a single abstract class. This new approach has important applications, including the retrieval and contextual understanding of artworks in Classical Archaeology.","prathmesh.madhu@fau.de, ronak.kosti@fau.de, torsten.bendschus@fau.de, corinna.reinhardt@fau.de, vincent.christlein@fau.de, andreas.maier@fau.de, peter.bell@fau.de",Lightning

The onset of this new endeavor is said to have coincided with a devastating marital crisis—a financially risky divorce to be exact—decreasing substantially his pictorial output. Writing now became his al­ternative outlet. Not surprisingly, Picasso’s poetry is quite visual. While other poets in the past have added graphic elements to enhance their poems, their use in Picasso is of special importance as they are an essential component of his writing. Furthermore, the method he used in his poetic compositions is essentially combinatorial in nature, with words co-occurring often in unexpected ways, this relates to his collage technique during Cubism. Examples of these features are shown in figures 1 and 2. Among the graphic elements Picasso includes in his poems are dashes, brackets, arrows, lines, blots, etc.  The combinatorial nature of his writing highlights the interconnections between words and graphic elements (Mallen 2003). This combination of unique graphic and verbal components in Picasso’s poetry leads us to view the poems as a set distinct layers of text and images that form the layout of a document—making it quite hard to define different boundaries while providing an important contribution to the interpretation of the layers of text. Additionally, Picasso's poems are often revisited multiple times, and he kept a record of all the changes from one state to another at various moments of their creation.  Each layer with new additions and deletions is carefully dated by the author, indicating the importance that each of them had for him. The “final” published copy is artificial in the sense that the printed version has been subjected to a frozen linearized transcription (often carried out by Picasso’s secretary, Jaime Sabartés) and fails to portray the information in the additional layers that can be found in the original manuscripts which fortunately have been preserved.We previously concluded that there is a close correlation between graphic elements and the verbal context in which they occur (Meneses and Mallen 2017) and offered a solution to encode graphic features and stratified text in machine-readable form (Mallen and Meneses 2019). However, identifying and encoding the graphical elements in the corpus of poems can be a laborious and intensive process. In this paper we will present a new approach that uses OpenCV, a library of programming functions aimed at real-time computer vision (OpenCV 2019), to identify the graphic elements in Picasso’s poetry. More specifically, we will present our findings on training the models, and discerning between false positives and negatives. This analysis will get us closer to understanding how the presence of graphic elements in a specific line of a poem affects the interpretation of the word string in that line and of the poem as a whole. Our final goal is to provide a systematic encoding of both the text and the graphic elements so that their mutually dependent interpretation may be properly evaluated.","enriquemallenphd@gmail.com, ldmm@uvic.ca",Short Presentation

By an “institutional DH website,” we mean a community website, hosted by a given university or institution, that is explicitly devoted to the advancement, support, and promotion of DH work collectively. A number of previous attempts to establish institutional DH websites have failed, and there is a growing need to understand how we can sustainably create and maintain such sites in a way that meets the diverse needs of DH scholars. To this end, we offer an alternative approach for creating such communal sites that is designed for specific communities. More than merely providing a definition of DH and a set of resources for those interested in the field, institutional DH websites can beneficially act as community hubs for DH practitioners by showcasing live projects and encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, an open development process can help scholars and DH staff who face long-standing DH challenges around methodological innovation, data reproducibility, reinvention of the wheel, and the balance of technical and humanistic priorities. In particular, we offer a user-focused development process for DH websites, which emphasizes the identification and enhancement of human networks and communities of practice. At the most basic level, user-focused design starts with a needs assessment of the website’s primary audience and is refined through attention to typical user needs and exemplary uses throughout the project’s lifecycle in order to maintain an active user community. This stands in contrast to the design of institutional DH sites as a means of cataloguing the services or offerings at a specific institution. At the structural level, user-focused design for institutional DH sites foregrounds open access and accessibility by thinking about these concerns throughout the design process (rather than as a last-minute add-on). The two speakers have designed institutional DH websites at the University of Virginia and Bucknell University, each employing a different platform (Drupal and WordPress); nonetheless, both sites promote similar design philosophies. The talk will model how institutions can create similar sites designed for their own communities with an eye toward developing appropriate use cases and sustainability practices.","mapp@virginia.edu, cfh008@bucknell.edu",Lightning

This paper presents a case study of a recent undergraduate seminar that sought answers to this question through a deep mapping of the long history of Northfield, MN, before and after its most well-known era of late nineteenth-century European settlement. Students were introduced to digital mapping technologies including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), web mapping frameworks, 3D modeling, and video game engines, which they used to map the long history of the region from geological time through its historical origins as part of the Dakota homelands, to its recent past and present as a region of increasingly diverse immigrants. The results (while still a work in progress) prove that digital deep mapping methods are particularly well suited for sharing human-centered stories grounded in land, region and community.  Deep mapping is as much archaeology as it is cartography, plumbing the depths of a particular place to explore its diversity through time. The term was coined by William Least Heat­-Moon, whose book PrairyErth set the standard as a richly layered, historical and literary study of the land and peoples of Chase County, Kansas. “Deep mapping” has since been taken up by the digital and spatial humanities communities to explore how issues like time depth, multivocality, and uncertainty — notoriously hard to represent in traditional printed maps — can be visualized using today’s digital mapping and interactive programming techniques. Figure 1: “A Deep Map of Northfield MN,” a digital remix of PrairyErth’s main elementsOver the course of 10 weeks, the students and I collaboratively built a “deep map” website that tells a series of spatial stories, built in numerous platforms and organized geographically, but linked together through modern web development tools. Inspired by PrairyErth, our goal was to construct a deep map that ""encompasses a range of approaches—cartographic, geographical, historical, literary, philosophical, scientific, anthropological, sociological and theological—to weave multiple strands of evidence, observation, impression and memory into a distillation of place."" Least Heat-Moon organized his book (somewhat arbitrarily) by US Geological Survey quadrangles, further dividing those sections into chapters that focus on one physical or thematic aspect of the territory. Our website would do the same, with sections devoted to each quadrangle surrounding Northfield MN and 3-5 sub-pages narrating and illustrating distinct aspects of that quadrangle's spatial history. Figure 2: Primary navigation of the website is via USGS Quadrangle maps. The key innovations of our remix of PrairyErth’s main elements were: 1) multivocality, allowing numerous authors to deepen each other’s insights, and 2) leveraging digital mapping technologies to make these ""chapters"" interactive and publicly accessible through the internet. ESRI StoryMaps narrate the fraught migrations in the region, from ancestral Dakota peoples, to Czech and Norwegian immigrants, to the current increase in Somali and other West African populations. 3D GIS scenes and embedded Unity games allow surrogate experiences of movement through the landscape, while custom scripts juxtapose individual maps with quotations from our collective Common Place Book (a concept again borrowed and digitally updated from Least Heat-Moon). Figure 3: “Somali Map of Faribault,” by Zoe Denckla ’20 using Google Tour Creator The aim of this paper is to share our experiences and open a dialogue about deep mapping as a method for collaborative public scholarship that can connect engaged undergraduate learning with the needs of community partners while staying firmly grounded in place.",amason@carleton.edu,Short Presentation

Most technical tutorials for DH leave the expected language unstated, with an implicit assumption that readers will be working with English. Non-English, non-national language literature departments at institutions worldwide tend to be small, making it more likely that anyone using DH methods in these departments will have to do so without a local support network of colleagues who are engaged in working through the issues that inevitably arise.The Russian Natural Language Processing working group (Russian NLP) models a new approach to addressing the resource and support needs of a distributed network of scholars who apply DH methods to a non-English, non-national language. Formed in 2019 with support from Stanford University’s Division of Literatures, Cultures, and Languages, the Russian NLP working group has brought together graduate students, faculty, librarians, and staff who work with Russian literary and/or historical texts. The group meets monthly, despite the scheduling challenges inherent in the wide dispersal of its membership, ranging from the west coast of the United States to Moscow. During the course of the 2019-2020 academic year, the group will identify natural-language processing tools and libraries available for working with Russian, and will find or build corpora that are representative of the materials that underpin the participants’ own research areas (e.g. 20th century diaries and letters, 19th century novels and plays, 21st century internet text). The group will evaluate the existing tools using these corpora, and will write up reviews of the tools’ performance when applied to different kinds of texts, in order to facilitate other scholars’ decision-making about which tools to adopt for their own DH work with Russian-language materials. In addition, the group will be writing technical tutorials, and is exploring the possibility of collaborating with the developers of English-language NLP tools to adapt them for use with Russian.This poster will present the major results of the group’s work for this year (e.g. the evaluation of existing tools for different kinds of Russian corpora), as well as reflections on the group’s organization and approach, and the challenges it has encountered. We anticipate that this will be of interest and value to anyone working with non-English materials who wants to cultivate a virtual community of practice around applying DH methods to their language.","sarmceleney@gmail.com, kaylin.land@mail.mcgill.ca, ajanco@haverford.edu, qad@stanford.edu",Poster

However, rarely do scholars think about issues related to the act of writing and, in addition, we have far from exhausted the potential for digital technologies to enhance writing and editing practices.Moreover, the tools available for writing in an academic context are limited, often proprietary and rarely designed and adapted to the needs of HS researchers. In concrete terms, almost all scientific production in HS today uses a single software and the same format: Word and docx, both of which are owned by Microsoft. Designed for all contexts ― although particularly intended for office use, as the name indicates ―, this duo is poorly adapted to the specific needs of scholars. Stylo is also a tool for writing and editing scientific texts, specifically designed to meet the challenges of scholarly digital publishing. Stylo is still a prototype; its development remains strongly linked to theoretical thinking on writing in a digital environment.  Many less successful software have and continue to be developed. However none have come close to rivalling Microsoft’s dominance on the world stage of writing tools. The ambition of the project is not so much to create an umpteenth tool, but to think about the epistemological stakes of writing practices in digital environments. How do these new forms of writing structure thought? The philosophy of Stylo builds on the simple fact that writing skills are semantic rather than graphic, and yet, authors of scholarly articles are often asked to deliver graphical layout rather than enriched text. Indeed, writing tools have a major impact on the production of knowledge: they influence content structure; define content accessibility criteria; determine the durability or obsolescence of content.Almost all scientific content is still produced with proprietary word processing software that is not conceptualised and designed for academic use, namely Microsoft Word (Kirschenbaum Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing 2016). However, this tool for the general public has problematic shortcomings for scientific publishing in HS:- The principle of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) confuses structuring and formatting: to facilitate the reading and processing of an article or book, the semantic value of fragments must be dissociated from their graphic rendering, for example: a level 2 title and its graphic rendering in a large font size. Stylo belongs to this type of initiative, alongside Software Studies (Fuller Software Studies: A Lexicon 2008).- The docx format does not allow the contents page to be structured scientifically. The contents produced in docx are poorly tagged and difficult to access because they are not indexed. At a time when text production has never been so abundant, it is crucial that documents be properly structured to improve their indexing and allow them to be queried using advanced search tools.- Publishers undertake the long and tedious task of reworking texts in order to reintroduce a semantic layer and to correct the many errors created by these word processors.- The durability of documents in docx format depends on Microsoft's willingness to maintain this proprietary format. However, sustainability is neither the mission nor the priority of a commercial company. There is no guarantee that content in docx format will be accessible in the future.By closely studying the editorial practices of scientific journals in HS, it appears that, when passing from the author to the publisher to the distributor, the scientific article goes through highly disparate states and formats. This process results in a considerable loss of time, data and meaning.There is therefore an urgent need to conceptualise and experiment with new writing models that are better adapted to the needs of HS knowledge production.Stylo has been conceived to offer a complete and continuous workflow from writing to publishing and to avoid loss of data and meaning between the various editing stages. It gathers functionalities such as sharing, versioning, track changes, reference management, revision annotations, multi-format export, metadata aligned with online authorities (LOC, Rameau, Wikidata, ORCID, ...) and inline semantic markup. In order to avoid frequent data breaches during editing processes, Stylo offers a continuous workflow from writing to dissemination, ensuring that semantic information provided by the author will indeed be published.Stylo can provide multiple outputs, depending on the needs of the author and the publisher: 1. XML (Érudit, JATS, TEI, etc.) for diffusion and harvesting platforms 2. HTML5 for direct publication on CMS 3. PDF & EPUB with programmable stylesheets 4. ODT, DOCX for common useBased on modular, lowtech and standard editing tools and formats, such as markdown, bibtex, Pandoc, Hypothes.is and LaTeX, Stylo integrates, into a single interface, the best practices in terms of web-based writing and publishing.In the digital chain of writing and publishing scholarly journals in HS, it is increasingly clear that the publisher no longer has control over the cultural, social or technical existence of its contents in an environment that is increasingly dependent on text-related data. Indeed, making a text exist in the digital environment implies exposing sufficiently rich and relevant data so that the contents be indexed by search engines. Stylo contends that each actor, from the author to the disseminating platform, is likely to be involved in a production process that guarantees the continuity of data. This is possible thanks to the sharing of a single pivotal format that is simple to access and use, and rich enough for the publishing of scientific texts in the humanities and social sciences.In this vision, writing is no longer just writing. Writing in the digital environment becomes part of a publishing dynamic. In other words, the act of writing necessarily goes hand in hand with the act of publishing. This idea that writing = writing + structuring brings us closer to a culture of digital literacy, which enables a mastery over the writing environment and an ability to inscribe space as much as to structure it. It is a matter of both knowing how to evolve in this environment and how to make it evolve. As pragmatic research project, Stylo works alongside the practitioners of writing and scholarly publishing, aiming for an evolution and an enrichment of these practices and inviting actors to reflect on the most effective means to harness the power of the digital environment.","margot.mellet@umontreal.ca, antoine.fauchie@umontreal.ca, nicolas.sauret@umontreal.ca, marcello.vitali.rosati@umontreal.ca, arthur.juchereau@gmail.com",Poster

We presented papers at Digital Humanities 2017, 2018, and 2019 that explored the abandonment and the average lifespan of online projects in the digital humanities (Meneses and Furuta 2017), contrasted how things have changed over the course of a year (Meneses et al. 2018), and introduced a strategy for preservation by creating standalone software executables (Meneses et al. 2019). However, managing and characterizing the degradation of online digital humanities projects is a complex and pressing problem that demands further analysis.In this sense “planned obsolescence” is a nuanced designation —as there are many cases of successful projects in digital humanities that are shifting their focus from active development to data management (for example: http://cervantes.dh.tamu.edu). These are cases where a project’s online presence has not received updates for some time but its online tools are stable and continue to be accessed by its users. However, if updates are not applied to the infrastructure or content of a project over time web requests will eventually start generating errors on the server or the client —affecting the overall user experience (Nowviskie and Porter 2010). These are examples of why the rules for traditional resources do not fully apply and new metrics are needed to identify issues concerning online projects in the digital humanities.In this study we dive deeper into exploring the distinctive signs of abandonment to quantify the planned obsolesce of online digital humanities projects. In our workflow, we use each project included in the Book of Abstracts that is published after each Digital Humanities conference from 2006 to 2019. We then proceed to periodically create a set of WARC files for each project, which are processed using Python (van Rossum 1995) and Apache Spark (Apache Software Foundation 2017) to statistically analyze the retrieved HTTP response codes, number of redirects, DNS metadata and detailed examination of the contents and links returned by traversing the base node. This combination of metrics and techniques has allowed us to assess the degree of change of a project over time. As one of the results from our 2019 presentation, we claimed that the most important signature for degradation comes from the assessing the validity and overall health of the topology of links in a project. Thus, the focus of our study is analyzing this key signature.We acknowledge that research on the preservation of projects in the digital humanities is also carried out by other groups (Larrousse and Marchand 2019) (Arneil, Holmes, and Newton 2019). However, our study is different as it focuses on two points: first, identifying the signals of abandoned projects using computational methods; and second, quantifying their degree of abandonment. In the end, we intend this study to be a step forward towards better preservation strategies for the planned obsolesce of online digital humanities projects.","ldmm@uvic.ca, jonathan.d.martin@kcl.ac.uk, furuta@cse.tamu.edu, siemens@uvic.ca",Poster

The project is the result of a longstanding research partnership between Adelson and Whapmagoostui FN that dates back to the late 1980’s. The research data archives consists of a large corpus of materials, including: over 60 hours of digitized audio recordings; over 2,000 digitized colour photographs; and over 50 interview transcripts which have been digitally migrated from 3 ½ inch floppy disks.   (Figure 1: Aerial view of Whapmagoostui First Nation)The MRDAP raises important questions regarding the limitations of existing library and archival principles; the legal and practical barriers to Indigenous data sovereignty; and the role of repositories with colonial histories in stewarding research data originating from Indigenous communities. Can the materials in the archives coexist as Indigenous cultural memory and academic research data? In what ways are these values (in)commensurable? How is community control over data access, dissemination, reproduction, and preservation being navigated? What ought to be the role of the non-Indigenous cultural heritage professional in this relationship? (Figure 2: Photograph from the Miiyupimatisiiun Research Data Archives)This presentation will engage with these questions from the perspective of the settler archivist who digitized the research data archives.

There is much discussion among the Digital Humanities community about the production of such resources, but: How are they experienced by end users? How might they be made more accessible to a wider public? My paper aims to address these questions, based on findings from recent user research. I begin by outlining my study in relation to existing research, before discussing my findings (1). I end by summarising and providing initial recommendations (2), highlighting that data openness and accuracy do not guarantee accessibility without human intervention.Background: Linked Data and user researchLinked Data has the potential to transform Humanities research by making new connections, visualising relationships, and facilitating access to a broader range of materials. Previous research has, however, identified a number of barriers to its production in a Humanities context, including the amount of training required, lack of awareness of its benefits, and unwillingness to depart from familiar tabular formats (Barbera, 2013, pp. 96, 98; Isaksen, 2011, pp. 153–154; van Hooland & Verborgh, 2014, p. 51). I aim to identify and address barriers to Linked Data use, rendering supposedly ‘open’ data resources unusable outside a relatively niche segment of the research community. Although initiatives such as Pelagios emphasise the importance of a user-centred approach to development (Simon, Barker, Isaksen, & de Soto Cañamares, 2015, pp. 54–56), in general there is less existing research on Linked Data use, as opposed to production. One exception (Angelis et al., 2015) studied use of the Europeana platform; findings included identifying the need for human-curated content as a ‘way in’ to the data. Limiting my study to researchers of the Ancient World, a microcosm of the Humanities, I set out to identify which Linked Data resources are used most frequently, explore users’ experiences of these resources, and recommend how they might attract a wider audience.Methodology: survey and interviewsTo obtain a breadth of views and in-depth understanding of specific cases, the study included a survey and interviews. Based on the assumption that few Ancient World researchers have used Linked Data, but many could benefit from it, I aimed the survey at all Ancient World researchers who use digital tools and resources, intending to apply more generic findings to Linked Data specifically. 212 participants responded, who were predominantly:associated with universities (academics, researchers, or students); aged 25-44;from the UK, US or Germany (although 32 countries were represented). There were slightly more women than men, with a small proportion who preferred not to provide their gender, or to self-describe. I selected an interview sample of 17, ensuring differing levels of technical experience, while being broadly demographically representative of the survey population. The combined survey and interview results comprise a cross-section of views relating to Linked Ancient World Data at the present time.Findings: curation and documentationThe 23% of participants who had knowingly used Linked Data were asked about the tool or resource with which they are most familiar. Those discussed most often were Pleiades, Pelagios and Papyri.info. Features of these resources that participants particularly appreciated included:accessing multiple data sources from a single point;advanced search features;viewing connections between related entities.Such features were also of interest to Ancient World researchers more generally. Even those with limited technical experience showed an interest in integrating multiple resources and incorporating advanced query options to improve efficiency of discovery. Linked Data resources therefore clearly have a broad potential appeal.User experience comments on Pleiades, Pelagios and Papyri.info were largely positive, for example:""I found it user-friendly and intuitive."" [PART007, Survey] – on PelagiosHowever, some participants identified potential barriers:it was sometimes unclear where to start;documentation could be improved.Subsequent interview discussions indicated that, although clear documentation was appreciated, less technically experienced participants were unlikely to consult it at all due to an assumption that it would be too complex to understand. Participants’ suggestions for resolving the above barriers included:developing curated collections;incorporating use cases (""Clear case studies for non-technical people."" [PART054, Survey]).Both these suggestions harness human skills rather than relying solely on richness of data. Conclusions: the human factor Findings from this study illustrate the importance of human intervention to ensure that Linked Open Data is usable and accessible by a wider public, rather than leaving the data to speak for itself. Specific recommendations include:Curating content to provide a starting point for new users.Improving documentation, by:ensuring clarity of language for less technically experienced users;providing examples of how the resource has been used in the past or might be used in future;integrating more fully with the user interface, e.g. signposting relevant sections at key points in the user journey. Although any updates to a digital tool or resource require an investment of time and funds, the above actions would be less costly than redesigning a user interface and could potentially be as effective in broadening the potential audience. While the focus of this study was Linked Data, the findings should be viewed in the context of participants’ wider digital experiences; as such, these recommendations could equally apply to resources that employ a different technological approach.This work forms part of a wider PhD study, aiming to identify where Linked Data might be most effectively integrated with Ancient World research methodologies. The resulting recommendations should enable researchers with varying levels of technical skill to unlock its full potential.",sarah.middle@open.ac.uk,Short Presentation

Lists of cities and their relative distances, represented by many national “miles” or eventually the location of postal waystations, opened European travel to a broad readership. By the mid seventeenth-century, private and public individuals had access to, and knowledge of, a wide network of mounted couriers and staging posts, connecting trade, travel, and epistolary exchange from the hubs of Milan, Venice, and Innsbruck to Constantinople, Madrid, and the New World. European postal networks were complex carrefours, bringing together merchants, pilgrims, tourists, and diplomats in both real and imagined space.Digital spatial approaches often rely upon modern mapmaking and its assumptions of a decentered viewpoint, direct distances, and national boundaries. Scholars of indigenous mapping such as Paul Carter, Deborah Kirk and Jeremy Mikecz, have demonstrated the assumptions and limitations of such an approach. The application of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to a corpus of 70 published itinerary books models the organizing logic of the itinerary genre and hierarchization of regions, cities and routes. While the pilgrimage path of St. James and transalpine commercial routes were widely republished, dynamic networks based on the dates of first and last publication indicate the influence of new postal hubs, sea travel, and cartography on early modern conceptions of a connected Europe.  I draw on the prior work of Shawn Graham and Elijah Meeks to develop dynamic cartograms, while adding new emphasis to their documentation of a contemporary mental map. A combination of spatial representation with Social Network Analysis (SNA) better recreates the early modern experience of space. Utilizing the SNA, TSNA, and networkDynamic packages in R, I construct and measure dynamic network models for comparison with spatial maps. The itineraries linked locations along chained journeys from origin, to intermediary, to final destination, as they were experienced by travelers or couriers on the ground. The experience of travel was highly variable based on the political and environmental circumstances; a dynamic network more accurately conveys the changing nature of European space. Digital methods prove key for moving between scales of consideration, from following the fate of one city, to many linked cities, to entire regions or the network as a whole.

""Reading Certainty"" examines one critical step in that process, namely how a group of approximately 230 readers decided whether a statement about an event is credible and factual. That examination supports an exploration of how readers of primary evidence think about factual and counterfactual statements, and how they interpret the certainty with which a witness makes their statements. This presentation argues that readers of collections of witness testimony were more likely to agree about event descriptions when those providing the description are certain, and that the ability of readers to accept gradations of certainty were better when a witness described factual, rather than counter-factual events. These findings lead to a suggestion for how researchers in linguistics and the humanities could better model the question of speaker certainty, at least when dealing with the kind of narrative non-fiction one finds in witness testimony.As represented by the effort that has gone in to various truth and reconciliation processes, such as occurred in Canada from 2008-2015 about treatment of First Nations in the residential schools systems, or in South Africa that from 1996 to 1998 convened hearings on abuses perpetrated during the Apartheid period, these materials serve vitally important functions for people and communities. Thus, despite their challenges, they need to be included in the types of material made more readable by computational methods. Absent any quantitative approaches, these many tens of thousands of witness statements remain mostly unread, perceived only in the aggregate form of commissions’ reports.Various challenges make the understanding of event language in real-world documents a meaningful, but difficult research problem. Often, witnesses indicate space, time, and entities referentially more so than absolutely, so their stories are resistant to techniques like named entity or temporal recognition. Additionally, these types of stories are frequently feature fragmented syntactic structure and highly referential semantics. Also, it is common that a witness either does not know where or when something specifically happened, they elide that detail, or they do not have the language with which to talk about it. In testimony provided by a first responder to the World Trade Center attacks of September 11, 2001 in World Trade Center Task Force Interview No. 9110335, an EMT says, ""That's when we noticed a whole bunch of police cars responding somewhere"" (Times, 2004). The resistance engendered by ambiguity hinders the critical work of associative reading, where descriptions of events by one witness are correlated to descriptions of events by additional witnesses.While the kind of associative reading historians, linguists, and those studying narrative non-fiction could be supported by computational approaches, a critical framework to facilitate interpretation of event- related language is essential. One critical predicate for understanding the events that comprise these stories is the extent to which the speaker is certain about the statement they put forward. Any question about the computational reading of event language is conditioned on whether or not it might be something an algorithm can be trained to identify, in addition to whether that perspective is meaningful relative to understanding the witness, their statement, and the event to which they offer testimony. This measure of speaker certainty is also known as veridicality. A second critical predicate in relation to this material's role as an anchor of collective memory is the speaker's statement's facticity. Combined, these measures provide a first step in ascertaining whether the description of an event in one witness testimony can be legitimately connected to an event description from another testimony.To explore this idea, a large study was conducted that asked; how are certainty and uncertainty indicated in the language of witness statements, and how do readers interpret those statements. This research builds on the work of (Hyland, 2005); (De Marneffe et al., 2012); (Saurí and Pustejovsky, 2009, 2012); (Lee et al., 2015); and (Stanovsky et al., 2017) in the area of using NLP to quantify a speaker's certainty about their statements. Following the above examples, a questionnaire was created to gather judgments of veridicality from Amazon Mechanical Turk users. mTurk is a cloud-labor platform that connects workers with information processing tasks. For this task, first, sentences were extracted from different corpora of interviews from different contexts: the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the Cambodian Khmer Rouge Tribunal, interviews with survivors of the Holocaust, statements from survivors of the Rwandan genocide, and interviews with survivors of ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia. One goal of this study was to use real-world data, rather than simulated data. While it can be argued that simulated data would allow for a stronger statement to be made about the quantitative findings and sources of variation, it wouldn't reflect how witnesses use language, or how readers grapple with the complex problem of understanding witness testimony. A random sample of sentences containing about 800 events was taken from each of the seven corpora leading to a total of approximately 4,000 events. A total of 227 unique raters participated in the study providing a total of 27,800 individual event ratings. Those ratings were categorical, based upon the existing best model for assessing certainty according to the literature referenced above. However, a majority of raters were only likely to agree on the category when the event was considered to be Certain Fact, or Probable Fact. Table 1 below indicates the initial categories and when at least half of the raters of an item agreed.Table 1: Simple Majority Interrater AgreementThese findings suggest that NLP and computational social sciences should process assessments of veridicality with more allowances for counterfactual or uncertain statements, and more gradations of certainty and positive evidence. To better capture the relative certainty and facticity implied by those ratings, an alternative to simple majority agreement was implemented. Instead, the means of all valid ratings were calculated, then plotted where the x-axis denoted a continuum from counterfact, or event-negation, to fact, or event, and the y-axis denoted certainty. Those plotted results, shown in Figure 1, were clustered using a number of clusters determined by the elbow method, wherein the number of clusters is increased until an elbow appears in the graph. Based on these clusters, as shown in Table 2, I propose a new nine-element schema for the evaluation of veridicality. This new schema better reflects that better reflects how readers interpreted real-world testimony and the evidence from this study, and potentially better describes how readers process information about certainty and events in witness testimony.Table 2: K-means Clustering of Survey Results Figure 1: Clusters of Certainty to Uncertainty and Factual to Counterfactual StatementsWith this theoretically and empirically developed instrument, linguists, historians, and readers of narrative non-fiction such as witness statements, may be better able to move forward with methods for computational approaches to associative reading, and better able to reengage with the primary evidence of our societies truth and reconciliation processes.

In particular, the workgroup develops a digital workflow that combines stylometry, network analysis and GIS mapping to conduct a comprehensive digital study of the Chadwyck-Healey American-Drama Corpus 1714-1915 (ADC-CHC 2006) – a collection of 1500 American dramatic texts from three centuries. The project aims at the accomplishment of three overall research goals. First (A), we want to account for a number of about 150 texts by anonymous authors by measuring their stylometric distance to texts by known playwrights of the same corpus, using the Burrows’ Delta method (Burrows, 2002). Second (B), we want to study potential correlations between the linguistic origin (such as regional dialects) of authors (cf. Choiński,​ Eder​ ​&​ ​Rybicki, 2018) and the non-fictional spatial settings of a selected number of dramatic texts in a method that we call spatial stylometry. We propose spatial stylometry as a cross-section between geospatial humanities and stylometry. In our approach we combine the automatic extraction of geonames via Named-Entity Recognition (Spacy, NLTK) and match these entities with open repositories of geonames (such as the OpenStreetMap database). In a further step, we finally visualize the annotated results on a map that displays detected stylometric signals related to the spatial positioning of particular dramas. With this workflow, we wish to inquire whether detected real-word settings of a selected number of dramatic texts cluster in meaningful ways, approaching questions such as: are texts by playwrights from distinct regions also set in these places? and how do detected similarities between texts correspond to authorial and metatextual information such as race, class or gender? In a third avenue (C), we seek to enhance our study with a network analysis and distant reading of scenic presence of characters (cf. Trilcke, Fischer 2018) to find potential correlations between the social configuration of individual texts, their spatial styles as well as racial, ethinic or gender-specific configurations.   ","dennis.mischke@uni-potsdam.de, michalchoinski@gmail.com",Lightning

The IOM has also argued that understanding how people think and feel about migration is essential to the development of policy that supports the safe passage and successful integration of migrants into their new communities (2017). The United States receives more migrants per year than any other country (United Nations, 2016). It is also a country where migration is a prominent topic in social, political and media discourse. This poster reports the findings of an exploratory study whose principal research questions are: 1) What do Twitter users in the United States talk about in their migrant- and migration-related tweets, 2) how do authors feel when they tweet about these subjects, and 3) how do their sentiments and topics of interest compare to Twitter users residing outside the United States? To approach these questions, we apply sentiment analysis, topic modeling and time series analysis to 111,785 English language tweets containing the term “migrant” or “migration” collected from the Twitter API between January 21 and March 4, 2019. Our quantitative and computational methodology relied on descriptive statistics, the Python programming language, and associated libraries, such as the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text processing, Pandas for data manipulation, VADER for sentiment analysis, Gensim for topic modeling and Seaborn for data visualization. The visualized data shows that authors in the United States focused more on politics whereas authors in other countries focused more on humanitarian issues. Tweets from U.S. authors were more negative than those authored by residents of other countries, except when the topics of the tweets involved children. A time series plot revealed three sentiment spikes, one positive and two negative, over the course of the collection period. The negative spikes were partially explained by looking at word frequencies, visualized as word clouds, alongside news headlines for the dates in question. The positive spike was more difficult to explain because of the limitations of sentiment analysis and the negative nature of news reporting. Our findings cannot be generalized because the Twitter Search API does not generate a representative sample (González-Bailón, 2014). Future work could involve an improved sampling method that would permit the use of inferential statistical methods. The addition of multiple languages to the tweet dataset or social network data to the analysis may yield interesting new findings.","alayne.moody@mail.mcgill.ca, sunyam.bagga@mail.mcgill.ca",Poster

To perform reuse (e.g., cita- tions, allusion) detection using machine or deep learning techniques, models are rare and text for a specific time period of genre exists seldom.Previously, we modeled changes in parallel, his- torical English Bibles determining the ratio and type of modification. This work gives an under- standing of the degree, type and partition of mod- ification in historical text, which again is impor- tant to consider for example upfront a stylometry task. Modification can reach from inflection to replacement of semantically related words. Our approach therefore used normalizing tools and looked-up lexical databases (e.g., WordNet and BabelNet Navigli and Ponzetto (2010)) to identity semantic relations (synonymy, hyper(o)nymy, co- hyponymy, see Fig. 1). We found 90% of the rela- tions that two statistically aligned words share.Now, we attempt to relate the last 10% using embedding representations of words from one pre- existing embedding model—based on historical English ranging from 1800 to 1900, henceforth StanHistEmb(1)—and one self-trained model— based on the Royal Society Corpus (Kermes et al., 2016) ranging from 1665 to 1869, henceforth RoySocEmb). We think the latter performs bet- ter being tailored well to the actual historical vo- cabulary. We complete the work with first manual evaluation. Before, Faruqui et al. (2015) refined word vec- tor representations using precise relations of semantic lexicons. Evaluation against shows a per- formance increase of 13% compared to earlier ap- proaches. Naya (2015) use neural models to pre- dict the correct hypernym of a word in a vec- tor space and achieves an accuracy of 20% for predicting whether the correct vector is among the 10 nearest. Weeds et al. (2014) train an SVM on word vector pairs achieving an error- rate-reduction of about 15% and find that distance scores between paired vectors work well for en- tailment tasks while adding vectors is useful for co-hyponymy determination.Data Used: We use aligned Bibles from 1500–1900 (each with each other). Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al., 2006) aligns verse-aligned Bibles on token-level. Figure 1: Modification examples during alignment Recall Using StanHistEmb: First, we calcu- late the cosine distance for two word vectors us- ing the StanHistEmb vectors attempting to retrieve both words from each couple in the model. We find a cosine distance to 260,641 couples, which are normally distributed over the distance scale. Figure 2: Distribution of cosine distance measures of the word couples determined with the StanHistEmb (o) and the RoySocEmb (x) modelRecall Using RoySocEmb: Now, we calcu- late the cosine similarity for two words using a self-trained RoySocEmb model and the Gensim li- brary. We find a cosine score to 302,812, much more than using StanHistEmb. Here, couples are even better normally distributed (Figure 2, curve of x), but values are lower due to a better tailored model, which in the sum is much smaller while supporting more historical vocabulary. Precision Using StanHistEmb: We manually evaluate 138 sample couples that have a cosine similarity(5) > .5. We assign 1.0 when two words are synonyms and 0.0 when there is no semantic relation. Principally, scores from 0.0 to 0.4 represent false positives. While many couples scored above .5 are strongly related or synonym. We not yet manually evaluated sam- ples for RoySocEmb. However, we looked up the same samples using that model and find 119 out of which 69 scored > .5 and 77 scored > .4. How- ever, looking at the skipped couples, they tend to be false positives for high similarity. Table 1: Semantic relation score between word cou- ples filtered using a cosine similarity of > .5 using the StanHistEmb modelForecast: We plan to investigate the selftrained model of Early Modern English more deeply. Specially to see in more detail whether and how the size of the model influences the accu- racy of the words’ relations. Therefore, we con- sider to refine the pre-trained model by retrain- ing and consider joining both models, because the RoySocEmb fits our time, but not our domain.",maria.berger@dfki.de,Lightning

It specifically looks at the development of new media technologies such as geo-fenced digital audio walks give listeners an opportunity to eavesdrop on a multitude of stories and voices, creating a palimpsest between the visible physical environment and the suggested future or imagined past. Coming from a performance background, I look at how performative works can extend themselves into both a physical and virtual space through an investigation of history and public participation. I will present a tour of three such digital geo-fenced audio works staged in South Africa: “ukubekindlebe” - commemorating 200 years since the Battle of Grahamstown in today’s Makhanda, “All Who Listen” - built out of extracts of the playscript All Who Pass capturing a family’s last night in District Six, Cape Town prior to the forced removals of the 1970s, and a third yet unnamed project built upon public stories. Using Achille Mbembe’s claim that the “Internet is Afropolitan” (2015), this presentation makes a connection linking the oral histories of indigneous community storytellers to today’s podcast culture. The circulation, migration, and transformation of stories across time and space, a feature of myths of origin, now is made manifest in our ears as we navigate a place. I examine how a critical appreciation can spur a reinvestigation and revoicing of history as a crucial part of our communities’ futures. I further propose, within this area of Digital Humanities, libraries as the pointer towards these intersections, to archive, publish and share these aural works. So the library becomes a virtual space which is both on the internet and with the people who can tell you where to look and who to find. The librarians return to being the oral storytellers of the fourth industrial revolution.",sanjin.muftic@uct.ac.za,Short Presentation

The corpus of the pilot phase consists of drama in English, 1550-1660. The goal is to foster a community of researchers to contribute to a growing dataset of annotations that will, ultimately, be part of a public-facing site. To date, there have been two major trends in annotation scholarship: the study of remarkable men (e.g. John Dee) and the study of remarkable books (e.g. a copy of Shakespeare’s First Folio held at Meisei University). DH work on annotations has followed suit, striving to make annotations by particular readers in particular books easily searchable.Common Readers stands in contrast to both these scholarly trends in its potential to illuminate the reading habits of the less extraordinary, anonymous men and women who read, marked, and commented upon texts. This talk will introduce the audience to Common Readers and solicit feedback on the existing annotations data module to improve its implementation, accessibility, and appeal to a variety of users. It considers the construction of the data schema through particular use cases as an opportunity to reflect on the process of structuring data, and in particular on the practical and scholarly implications of the choice between an hierarchical encoding structure like TEI and a relational database. (For an example of the former, see the Archaeology of Reading project; for an example of the latter see Derrida’s Margins.)Moreover, this talk will consider the way in which annotated books--as multivalent, hybrid objects--challenge many traditional structuring principles in and outside of DH. As an inquiry into the best approach to annotation studies, Common Readers raises broader questions about the ontology of annotated documents that engage many disciplines and subfields, offering potential applications for researchers who are curating data about complex material objects, designing platforms for capturing annotations, or practicing scholarship related to object-oriented ontology.In this emphasis on data structures, Common Readers seeks community guidance on its approach to making highly particular data not only publicly shareable but widely useful. Originally, the plan was to provide the (future) public site with an export function, allowing users to work with project data in whatever way best suited their needs, and to deposit versioned datasets for general use in a repository like Zenodo. Both practices are likely to benefit other early modernists, but probably not a general audience. While the appeal of Linked Open Data (LOD) is strong) the best way in which to structure such highly specific data (derived from a very particular use case) in a way that would comply with recognized standards and be widely machine-readable remains unclear. The project team welcomes advice in establishing these best practices, as well as for redesigning the annotations data module itself.",rmunson@princeton.edu,Lightning

While the necessity of high quality research data manageNow that the Digital Humanities (DH) are becoming a well-established research field, producing seminal publications in print as well as digital formats, the time for consolidation has come. It is noteworthy that digital tools and methods from the pioneering days of the DH are degrading and some have already vanished. Therefore, it is urgent to take action and to prevent further losses. While the necessity of high quality research data management (RDM) is encouraged or even required by funding agencies and there is an increasing awareness for long-term archiving (LTA), when it comes to primary research data, the fact that the DH exhibit a structural deficit regarding maintaining and preserving research software is at the least underestimated.In this panel, we will focus on infrastructure and institutional support. Beginning with an overview of existing strategies from the DH and beyond, we highlight selected strategies to compare how they are implemented at different institutions in terms of infrastructure, expert knowledge and also funding. We also want to evaluate the extent of institutional support that is needed to successfully sustain and archive DH projects and the software they use. We will discuss currently implemented solutions to maintain and preserve research projects and software, all of which approach the outlined problem from a different angle.1. Sustainability Strategies in DH and beyond (Brigitte Mathiak, Data Center for the Humanities, University of Cologne)Sustainability of research software is an important issue for the DH. In our investigation of the “Digital Scholarly Editions“ online catalogue, we compared the time stamps of the last seen version on the Internet Archive with the first seen version (Schildkamp & Mathiak, 2019). We discovered that of 466 digital editions, 376 had disappeared. The average life time is 8.5 years, while the half life time is about 6 years. We expect that other DH projects exhibit similar trends. The reasons for the disappearance of these valuable research resources are manifold: diminishing funding, lack of institutional support and, over time, lack of personnel support as researchers switch career paths or research directions. The “Digital Dark Age” (Whitt, 2017) affects not only our digital cultural heritage, but also the born digital outcomes of scholarly labor. The problem of sustainability is neither unknown, nor without solutions. Several different models have been explored within the DH community. These include the development of centers such as CHNM, consortia such as Europeana, Hathitrust, and DPLA, as well as community partnerships such as Samvera (previously Hydra) and Islandora. Individual institutions such as those represented on this panel have taken up responsibility for the resources that were placed in their care. Yet, there is a dazzling variety of strategies, technologies, and policies that have been adopted to improve the elusive sustainability, e.g. code archiving, open source dissemination, duplication, sandboxing, refactoring, unified tech stacks, virtual research environments, virtualization, and use of the Internet Archive. While it is clearly easier to prepare a project for sustainability in the planning stage, advice for enhancing sustainability is divergent, ranging from using simple technology, someone’s preferred infrastructure, or particular documentation practices. Many completed projects do not have a sustainability strategy, either because they were too old or too optimistic. What happens to these projects is often determined by funding and institutional support. The luxury version is a complete redesign with all the newest bells and whistles, but there are also cheaper strategies, such as putting the system in a sandbox, or relying on the Internet Archive.However, the problem of sustainability is not unique to the DH. Basic sciences (biology and physics), atmospheric and space sciences, as well as geosciences are some disciplines that are developing sustainability enhancing mechanisms. In conjunction with funding agencies such as the National Science Foundation, researchers in these disciplines have attempted approaches such as community engagement in software and schema development (Specify), ongoing external funding for maintenance (rather than only for new research), long-term funding arcs (NSF centers), funding agency mandates (contribution of digitized data to existing repositories), efforts to desilo or integrate resources (iDigBio, iPlant), and institutional support for pre-publication drafts (arXiv). We will explore the breadth of these approaches as well as the expected and actual impact of these strategies on sustainability of products that are critical for scholarship in these disciplines, and connect the dots by drawing parallels to the DH.2. TOSCA-based Application Management (Claes Neuefeind and Philip Schildkamp, Cologne Center for eHumanities/Data Center for the Humanities, University of Cologne)The University of Cologne’s Data Center for the Humanities (DCH) is obliged to concern itself with the sustainability of all digital artifacts produced during (Digital) Humanities projects, e.g. as run by the Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH). And as such, it is not only committed to the long-term preservation of data, but of so-called “living systems” (Sahle & Kronenwett, 2013) as well. With regards to this necessity, the DCH is currently engaged in the DFG-funded project “SustainLife – Sustaining Living Digital Systems in the Humanities” (Neuefeind et al., 2018), conducted in cooperation with the Institute of Architecture of Application Systems (IAAS) of the University of Stuttgart. The project aims at adopting the “Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications” (TOSCA) standard (OASIS, 2013 and 2019) to the field of Digital Humanities. Being an industry standard focussed on deployment and maintenance of complex software services, TOSCA allows to model applications as abstract topologies consisting of reusable components, while avoiding any kind of vendor or technology lock-in. Through this meta-modelling of software components, not only can the deployment context be adjusted easily (e.g. deployments geared towards OpenStack can easily be adjusted towards Docker, VMWare vSphere, etc.), but from the reusability of said components, synergetic effects emerge, lessening the overall administrative costs for long-term archiving and deployment of research applications.In our contribution to the panel, we will present the methodological concept of our approach based on the OpenTOSCA ecosystem (Breitenbücher et al., 2016), an open-source implementation of the TOSCA standard, as well as a distinct set of use case implementations conducted within the SustainLife project. The use cases to be presented will cover some of the typical technology stacks in the DH. Foremost, the (1) EarlyCinema use case stands for one of the most common technology stacks: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Further, the (2) AutoPost and (3) TiwoliJ use cases employ the popular Java framework Spring(Boot) with a MySQL database as persistence layer. Also implemented using Spring(Boot), but persisting data in MongoDB, employing ElasticSearch as indexing service and packing a ReactJS frontend, the (4) VedaWeb use case represents one of the more specialized stacks. And lastly the (5) Musical Competitions Database is the most specialized use case, as it depends on older versions of CouchDB for data persistence and ElasticSearch for indexing persisted data (Neuefeind et al., 2019).3. GAMS: Geisteswissenschaftliches Asset Management System (Unmil Karadkar, Johannes Stigler, Elisabeth Steiner, Gunter Vasold, and Fabio Tosques, Centre for Information Modelling, University of Graz)Recognizing the problems inherent in conducting digital humanities research based on stand-alone, custom software, The Centre for Information Modeling has developed, maintained, and enriched GAMS – a modular, standards-based, community-used software – since the early 2000’s, gaining over 15 years of experience in sustaining a digital scholarship infrastructure. The GAMS infrastructure is supported by ongoing relationships with researchers, personnel, processes, and certifications that inform a holistic, long-term sustainability philosophy. Thus, GAMS embodies a strategy for digital preservation that has been hardened through software upgrades, continuous use, and external testing. GAMS hosts over 95,000 compound digital objects and supports over 90 digital humanities projects. Infrastructure: The GAMS software is developed using open software and platform-independent standards. These include FEDORA – a flexible open repository infrastructure, Blazegraph, a standards-based, high-performance graph database, Handle – a persistent identifier service, PostgreSQL, Apache Cocoon, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and LORIS IIIF image server. GAMS was initially developed using FEDORA 2.0 and over the years, has been migrated to FEDORA 3.5. The GAMS team has developed OAIS-compliant workflows in order to support long-term preservation. Data stored in GAMS is subject to FAIR data principles. Currently, the GAMS team is updating the backend to FEDORA 6.0. This upgrade presents unique challenges as FEDORA has outsourced the notion of content models since version 4.0 and model compliance must now be handled in the application layer. The modularity of the GAMS architecture facilitates such an upgrade as the Java-based Cirilo client supports the management of a legacy layer while migrating to a REST-API-based interface. Cirilo is developed on an open source philosophy and is available for download via GitHub. The user interface layer of the GAMS Web interface is based on Web technology standards, such as XML and XSLT that separate structure from content and enable multiple, context-specific renditions of Web-based information. Relationships: In order to ensure continued relevance, the GAMS team partners with humanities researchers. GAMS receives and stores data in recognized archive-compliant standards such as JPEG2000 and TIFF. In addition to interfaces for upload, management, and description of digital objects, the team consults with research partners about issues such as document digitization, ingest, description, and management, developing custom workflows, data models, deposit agreements, data management plans, and publication pipelines as necessary. Developed tools and techniques are available for other projects, thus enriching GAMS as well as the digital research environment for humanists. Personnel: Continuity of people is often correlated with the availability of infrastructure and data. In order to ensure long-term availability of the data as well as services, the centre invests in project staff for tasks such as software development, infrastructure management, processes, workflows, and content model design, as well as for document and metadata enrichment.Certifications: In a demonstration of our commitment for long-term preservation and to assure (potential) partners of this commitment, GAMS has undergone rigorous evaluation and has been certified as a trusted digital repository (since 2014), carries the CoreTrustSeal (since 2019), and is registered with the Registry of Research Data Repositories (ROAR).4. Managing 100 DH legacy projects and building new ones: a pragmatic and holistic approach to archiving and sustainability (Arianna Ciula and Brian Maher, King’s Digital Lab, King’s College London)King’s Digital Lab’s (KDL) (King’s College London) contribution to archiving and sustainability practices in Digital Humanities (DH) will be presented along the following dimensions: (Human) Sustainability of expertise: As generational change occurs and in line with reorientations across the DH community (see Boyles et al., 2018), it has become increasingly clear that the surest way to sustainability is to ensure continuity of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and tacit understanding. KDL conceived and adopted a relatively flexible model with defined career development document and Research Software Engineering (RSE) role definitions (Smithies, 2019). (Technical) Sustainability of systems and technical stack: The second dimension needed to sustain the DH tradition and fulfil KDL’s mandate to increase digital capability across the Arts & Humanities is caring for the cluster of technical systems comprised of hardware and software, web servers, network infrastructure, application frameworks, programming languages, tools (for project, data and code management), and equipment. In practice, sustainable management of lab projects required the adoption of limited server and development environment stacks, in a move away from the more flexible but difficult to manage environment used in earlier eras (for more details of the tools used to support the stack see https://stackshare.io/kings-digital-lab). (Operational) Post-project integrated in the lab Software Development Lifecycle: The techniques used to manage KDL rich and heterogeneous estate of legacy projects matured into an ongoing process of archiving and sustainability tailored to the Lab’s historical, technical and business context. It is applied to new as well as legacy projects, in a manner that ensure systems as well as data are maintained throughout defined life-cycles (King’s Digital Lab, 2019). To control this, open ended Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts are offered to Principal Investigators (PIs) of collaborative research projects to secure maintenance of legacy projects in their live state; however, other options for archiving are also possible and assessed (see also Smithies et al. 2019 and https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0648.html). To make the overall approach sustainable, it had to be integrated into the lab’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC; see https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/sdlc-for-rse/), and in so doing align with KDL infrastructure architecture and core technical stack, while at the same time informing practices of forward planning for new projects. KDL’s contribution to the panel will reflect on how alignment across these three layers raises challenges but also poses the foundations for the sustainability of the Lab’s ecosystem, hopefully offering a reference for others to reflect upon, adapt and improve.5. Keeping it Simple and Straightforward (Greg Newton, Stewart Arneil, Martin Holmes, Humanities Computing and Media Centre, University of Victoria)The University of Victoria long ago demonstrated its commitment to DH research by providing base-budget funding for the five-person Humanities Computing and Media Centre (see https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/hcmc/) – a department in the Faculty of Humanities. As can be seen from the name, HCMC actually pre-dates the term Digital Humanities. As a base-budget funded department, HCMC has the capacity to take on projects regardless of their level of funding – we regularly take on projects with no funding at all – and the commitment to support the project's outputs in perpetuity. This is only possible due to a critical mass of professors and executives seeing value over time.For over twenty years HCMC has been consulting on and developing web applications in support of teaching and research. On behalf of our academic collaborators we work closely with library and systems colleagues who take primary responsibility for archiving and technical infrastructure, respectively. This is a strategic division of labour entailing ongoing communications with the benefits of specialization and scale.Over the years we have come to recognize the inherent dangers of creating teetering stacks of complicated, fashionable technology that cannot stand the test of time. Experiments with several CMS's, JavaScript libraries, and so forth has invariably led us to the conclusion that the long-term cost of coping with breakage and security problems outweighs the short-term value these applications and libraries offer.While we provide institutional support we are not keen on a never-ending cycle of upgrades and code-maintenance. To mitigate this we have become staunch supporters of KISS - in our case it might stand for ""Keep It Simple and Straightforward"". We take on very few projects that we did not develop, and when we do they are usually converted to a static site and archived or completely re-written.Our Project Endings (see https://projectendings.github.io/) survey and interviews have made us doubly aware of the potential for catastrophe using technology that is not proven to be simple and durable. From our perspective every project will benefit from adopting a KISS strategy, but perhaps especially those projects without institutional support.(RDM) is encouraged or even required by funding agencies and there is an increasing awareness for long-term archiving (LTA), when it comes to primary research data, the fact that the DH exhibit a structural deficit regarding maintaining and preserving research software is at the least underestimated.In this panel, we will focus on infrastructure and institutional support.

Through this meta-modelling of software components, not only can the deployment context be adjusted easily (e.g. deployments geared towards OpenStack can easily be adjusted towards Docker, VMWare vSphere, etc.), but from the reusability of said components, synergetic effects emerge, lessening the overall administrative costs for long-term archiving and deployment of research applications.In our contribution to the panel, we will present the methodological concept of our approach based on the OpenTOSCA ecosystem (Breitenbücher et al., 2016), an open-source implementation of the TOSCA standard, as well as a distinct set of use case implementations conducted within the SustainLife project. The use cases to be presented will cover some of the typical technology stacks in the DH. Foremost, the (1) EarlyCinema use case stands for one of the most common technology stacks: LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). Further, the (2) AutoPost and (3) TiwoliJ use cases employ the popular Java framework Spring(Boot) with a MySQL database as persistence layer. Also implemented using Spring(Boot), but persisting data in MongoDB, employing ElasticSearch as indexing service and packing a ReactJS frontend, the (4) VedaWeb use case represents one of the more specialized stacks. And lastly the (5) Musical Competitions Database is the most specialized use case, as it depends on older versions of CouchDB for data persistence and ElasticSearch for indexing persisted data (Neuefeind et al., 2019).3. GAMS: Geisteswissenschaftliches Asset Management System (Unmil Karadkar, Johannes Stigler, Elisabeth Steiner, Gunter Vasold, and Fabio Tosques, Centre for Information Modelling, University of Graz)Recognizing the problems inherent in conducting digital humanities research based on stand-alone, custom software, The Centre for Information Modeling has developed, maintained, and enriched GAMS – a modular, standards-based, community-used software – since the early 2000’s, gaining over 15 years of experience in sustaining a digital scholarship infrastructure. The GAMS infrastructure is supported by ongoing relationships with researchers, personnel, processes, and certifications that inform a holistic, long-term sustainability philosophy. Thus, GAMS embodies a strategy for digital preservation that has been hardened through software upgrades, continuous use, and external testing. GAMS hosts over 95,000 compound digital objects and supports over 90 digital humanities projects. Infrastructure: The GAMS software is developed using open software and platform-independent standards. These include FEDORA – a flexible open repository infrastructure, Blazegraph, a standards-based, high-performance graph database, Handle – a persistent identifier service, PostgreSQL, Apache Cocoon, Apache Lucene, Apache Solr, and LORIS IIIF image server. GAMS was initially developed using FEDORA 2.0 and over the years, has been migrated to FEDORA 3.5. The GAMS team has developed OAIS-compliant workflows in order to support long-term preservation. Data stored in GAMS is subject to FAIR data principles. Currently, the GAMS team is updating the backend to FEDORA 6.0. This upgrade presents unique challenges as FEDORA has outsourced the notion of content models since version 4.0 and model compliance must now be handled in the application layer. The modularity of the GAMS architecture facilitates such an upgrade as the Java-based Cirilo client supports the management of a legacy layer while migrating to a REST-API-based interface. Cirilo is developed on an open source philosophy and is available for download via GitHub. The user interface layer of the GAMS Web interface is based on Web technology standards, such as XML and XSLT that separate structure from content and enable multiple, context-specific renditions of Web-based information. Relationships: In order to ensure continued relevance, the GAMS team partners with humanities researchers. GAMS receives and stores data in recognized archive-compliant standards such as JPEG2000 and TIFF. In addition to interfaces for upload, management, and description of digital objects, the team consults with research partners about issues such as document digitization, ingest, description, and management, developing custom workflows, data models, deposit agreements, data management plans, and publication pipelines as necessary. Developed tools and techniques are available for other projects, thus enriching GAMS as well as the digital research environment for humanists. Personnel: Continuity of people is often correlated with the availability of infrastructure and data. In order to ensure long-term availability of the data as well as services, the centre invests in project staff for tasks such as software development, infrastructure management, processes, workflows, and content model design, as well as for document and metadata enrichment. Certifications: In a demonstration of our commitment for long-term preservation and to assure (potential) partners of this commitment, GAMS has undergone rigorous evaluation and has been certified as a trusted digital repository (since 2014), carries the CoreTrustSeal (since 2019), and is registered with the Registry of Research Data Repositories (ROAR).4. Managing 100 DH legacy projects and building new ones: a pragmatic and holistic approach to archiving and sustainability (Arianna Ciula and Brian Maher, King’s Digital Lab, King’s College London)King’s Digital Lab’s (KDL) (King’s College London) contribution to archiving and sustainability practices in Digital Humanities (DH) will be presented along the following dimensions: (Human) Sustainability of expertise: As generational change occurs and in line with reorientations across the DH community (see Boyles et al., 2018), it has become increasingly clear that the surest way to sustainability is to ensure continuity of technical expertise, domain knowledge, and tacit understanding. KDL conceived and adopted a relatively flexible model with defined career development document and Research Software Engineering (RSE) role definitions (Smithies, 2019). (Technical) Sustainability of systems and technical stack: The second dimension needed to sustain the DH tradition and fulfil KDL’s mandate to increase digital capability across the Arts & Humanities is caring for the cluster of technical systems comprised of hardware and software, web servers, network infrastructure, application frameworks, programming languages, tools (for project, data and code management), and equipment. In practice, sustainable management of lab projects required the adoption of limited server and development environment stacks, in a move away from the more flexible but difficult to manage environment used in earlier eras (for more details of the tools used to support the stack see https://stackshare.io/kings-digital-lab). (Operational) Post-project integrated in the lab Software Development Lifecycle: The techniques used to manage KDL rich and heterogeneous estate of legacy projects matured into an ongoing process of archiving and sustainability tailored to the Lab’s historical, technical and business context. It is applied to new as well as legacy projects, in a manner that ensure systems as well as data are maintained throughout defined life-cycles (King’s Digital Lab, 2019). To control this, open ended Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts are offered to Principal Investigators (PIs) of collaborative research projects to secure maintenance of legacy projects in their live state; however, other options for archiving are also possible and assessed (see also Smithies et al. 2019 and https://dev.clariah.nl/files/dh2019/boa/0648.html). To make the overall approach sustainable, it had to be integrated into the lab’s Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC; see https://kingsdigitallab.github.io/sdlc-for-rse/), and in so doing align with KDL infrastructure architecture and core technical stack, while at the same time informing practices of forward planning for new projects. KDL’s contribution to the panel will reflect on how alignment across these three layers raises challenges but also poses the foundations for the sustainability of the Lab’s ecosystem, hopefully offering a reference for others to reflect upon, adapt and improve. Keeping it Simple and Straightforward (Greg Newton, Stewart Arneil, Martin Holmes, Humanities Computing and Media Centre, University of Victoria). The University of Victoria long ago demonstrated its commitment to DH research by providing base-budget funding for the five-person Humanities Computing and Media Centre (see https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/hcmc/) – a department in the Faculty of Humanities. As can be seen from the name, HCMC actually pre-dates the term Digital Humanities. As a base-budget funded department, HCMC has the capacity to take on projects regardless of their level of funding – we regularly take on projects with no funding at all – and the commitment to support the project's outputs in perpetuity. This is only possible due to a critical mass of professors and executives seeing value over time. For over twenty years HCMC has been consulting on and developing web applications in support of teaching and research. On behalf of our academic collaborators we work closely with library and systems colleagues who take primary responsibility for archiving and technical infrastructure, respectively. This is a strategic division of labour entailing ongoing communications with the benefits of specialization and scale. Over the years we have come to recognize the inherent dangers of creating teetering stacks of complicated, fashionable technology that cannot stand the test of time.

"Nomura, Nichole Misako; Algee-Hewitt, Mark",Stanford University,Novel Worldbuilding: Science Fiction,"Worldbuilding, Microgenres, Science Fiction, NLP, Improbability","English, North America, 20th Century, Contemporary, text mining and analysis, Literary studies",English,North America,"20th Century, Contemporary",text mining and analysis,Literary studies,"Novel World-Building: Science FictionIntroductionThis project explores two narrative techniques that allow authors of Science Fiction (SF) to create and communicate invented worlds.Explicit Worldbuilding: Microgeneric worldbuildingExplicit worldbuilding--moments that appear to merely convey worldbuilding information--is simultaneously widely acknowledged as a unifying feature of the genre yet derided as “witless, even infantile.” Questions of when and how much explicit worldbuilding happens, then, might help us answer questions about prestige and more fundamental questions about the form of SF.After initial feature-finding forays into explicit worldbuilding, we turned to the Lit Lab’s Microgenres project, hoping to replicate their work on a specifically SF corpus. The Microgenres project seeks to identify extra-disciplinary discourses within narrative using a non-lexical approach. We hypothesized that moments of explicit worldbuilding might resemble these disciplinary discourses.CorpusTo test this hypothesis, we assembled a test corpus of 17 SF novels and 26 science texts written by Isaac Asimov, sampled to comparable size.MethodsWith the Microgenres feature set (including frequency of Penn Treebank POS tags, average sentence length, average number of clauses per sentence, and numbers of named entity persons), we created a classification model using linear discriminant analysis. By training a model on 20- and 50-sentence subsections of our corpus of science writing and then classifying similarly-sized passages of SF, we can use the posterior probabilities of the classification results to identify the mixture of science writing in each part of each SF novel.AnalysisThis section of the project seeks to answer two related questions. First, are there significant stylistic differences in Asimov’s science and science fiction? And, second, if those stylistic differences exist, can we identify moments where science style appears in SF? To answer the first question: yes. Our classification model had a success rate of 95% at the 50-sentence level and 91% at the 20-sentence level. Figure 1: Classification success rate, 50-sentence slicesTo answer the second question, we classified slices in each of the novels. For example, in the resulting graph of Second Foundation, each bar represents a 50-sentence slice of the text and the distribution of colors indicates the posterior probabilities of each discourse in each slice as assigned by the model. Slice 36, with the most “science,” contains an essay on the history of the Foundation.Figure 2: Classification of 50-sentence slices of Second Foundation (Im)probabilities and WorldbuildingIn implicit worldbuilding, authors juxtapose tokens that are familiar to readers within contexts in which their co-occurrence is unexpected, such as“the door dilated.”4 While both “door” and “dilated” are familiar to readers, their unexpected co-occurrence signals a new world.CorpusTo explore the role of syntagmatic pairs in implicit worldbuilding we expanded our corpus to include 246 SF novels published between 1905 and 2017, which we compared to a combined corpus of 146 novels from the same period tagged as “realism” and a corpus of 311,580 journal articles from Scientific American and the Journal of the British Medical Association (JBMA). MethodsWe tested normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI) as a means to identify such bigrams as above, but the sensitivity of PMI to low frequency words (rather than low frequency word pairings) made it unable to detect bigrams of the kind we sought. Our interest, in this particular project, is in improbable or novel combinations of otherwise normal frequency words--and the signal of those improbably-combined words are drowned out by the noise created by pairings of low-frequency words.In order to identify implicit worldbuilding, we introduce a new metric, improbability, as a way of measuring the significance of word pairs whose constituent elements occur in reference corpora, but whose combination is relatively unique to our target corpus.Subtraction of the probability of words x and y following each other in our reference corpus from our target corpus gave too much significance to instances in which rare tokens in the non-SF corpus skewed the probability of their co-occurrence. Accordingly, we scaled the resulting metric using the zeta measure of significance for the terms. This adjusted our metric to account for the relative significance of the terms in our corpora as described in Figure 3. The 15 most improbable word combinations indicative of SF when compared to the realism and JStor corpus are shown in Table 1. Our metric captures both syntagmatic worldbuilding (“haziness mars”) and a semiotics of science which places familiar objects in unfamiliar narrative contexts (“bunsen burner”). Table 1: Most improbable bigram sequences in SF novelsWe are also able to calculate the improbability score of all bigrams in a given segment of text. This allows us to locate segments of novels with a large number of improbable word combinations, not only revealing passages of specific novels in which implicit worldbuilding occurs, but laying the groundwork for uncovering larger patterns across novels. Figure 4: Improbability scores across The Dispossessed For example, Figure 4 shows a smoothed plot of the improbability scores across Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Dispossessed. We divided the novel into 100 overlapping segments, calculated the improbability score in each, and averaged the results across windows of 3 adjacent segments, revealing two peaks. Our metric captured these important moments of worldbuilding, both of which depict the narrator struggling to make sense of his situation.ConclusionsThe two methods we employ, microgenres and improbility, have proven successful at identifying key moments of worldbuilding in SF. More importantly, the two metrics correspond to explicit and implicit worldbuilding, creating the opportunity to study not just individual examples of how these two strategies are employed by authors at the level of the text, but also patterns that differentiate SF from other literary genres.","nnomura@stanford.edu, mark.algee-hewitt@stanford.edu",Long Presentation

As a relatively new sub-field of machine learning, interpretable machine learning aims to find potential solutions to the inevitable opacity of machine learning models applications by mitigating this opacity through the production of “explanations”.Such a mitigation has become increasingly relevant as machine learning models start to inform socially and politically relevant decision-making processes (Pasquale 2015, Benjamin 2019, Crawford and Paglen 2019). From the technical perspective, machine learning models thus become “interpretable” if they, either by design or with the help of external tools, can provide human-understandable explanations for their decisions, predictions, or classifications. In the past five years, various techniques have been developed to produce such explanations, including those targeted specifically at machine learning models operating on images, which are often subsumed under the term visual analytics (Hohman et al. 2018). Explanations in the image domain often function as visualizations, showing and thus explaining how a machine learning model arrives at a certain output.Beyond these technical results, however, a larger conceptual discussion has emerged in the technical disciplines that “infringes” on the terrain of the digital humanities. It is centered around attempts to find quantitative definitions for concepts that naturally emerge from the problem at hand, such as “interpretation” and “representation”, with the help of methods and concepts from disciplines as diverse as psychology, philosophy, and sociology (Kim et. al. 2019, Mittelstadt et. al. 2019, Selbst and Barocas 2018, Ritter et. al. 2017).Despite the emergence of this cross-disciplinary discussion, however, the interest in interpretable machine learning in the digital humanities community has so far been marginal. Among the few existing studies are Ted Underwood’s recent book (2019), which discusses interpretability in the appendix. Arnold and Tilton (2019) briefly examine interpretability in the context of an analysis of the “deepness” of deep learning methods. Finally, Alan Liu’s recent work on methods that allow a “close reading of distant reading” are also informed by a discussion of interpretability (Liu 2020). Generally, however, the notion of machine learning models as “impenetrable” black boxes (Arnold and Tilton 2019) persists in the digital humanities community.Counter to this narrative, in this paper, we argue that interpretable machine learning in general, and techniques from visual analytics in particular, can significantly improve digital humanities research by facilitating a critical machine vision approach to image data. We posit that, generally, interpretable machine learning provides a natural bridge between “close” and “distant” methods. In fact, it provides a critical and technical framework to analyze the “distant” methods themselves. As such, it addresses the question of open data from a meta-methodological point of view: if data is open, the methods which process the data need to be open as well. Importantly, this openness has to go beyond open source. It requires the development of tools that actively mitigate the general opacity of computational methods by making them interpretable, and thus allow them to be both tool and subject of a humanist analysis.Importantly, the opacity of machine learning models is as much a function of the phenomenological differences between human and machine perception as it is a function of model size (Burrell 2016; Selbst and Barocas 2018; Offert and Bell 2020). This is particularly relevant to digital humanities research on image data, where low-level computer vision methods are often employed to generate high-level hypotheses. For instance, it has been recently shown that deep neural networks often prefer textures over shapes (Geirhos et al. 2019), and generally rely on imperceptible image features (Ilyas et al. 2019). Visual analytics methods can discover such phenomenological biases in regard to specific datasets, and thus lower the risk of misguided higher-level conclusions based on machine predictions while not being subject to a trade-off between model capability and interpretability.In this paper, we present concrete results for the application of the “feature visualization” visual analytics method (Erhan et. al. 2009, Yosinski et. al. 2015, Olah et. al. 2017 ) to machine learning models trained on both a toy art historical corpus and the “standard” ImageNet/ILSVRC2012 dataset (Russakovsky et al. 2015). We demonstrate the potential and limitations of the technique, building upon previous work on attribution (Bell and Offert 2020).Concretely, we show that feature visualization, as a generative approach, offers intuitively interpretable visualizations, which points to an untapped general potential of generative methods like generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al. 2014). Feature visualization allows for the discovery of unexpectedly salient image features which can not be detected with attribution methods, and which mirror the phenomenological biases of the employed machine vision systems. In our experiments, for instance, which extend previous work (Offert 2018), it facilitated the discovery of a heavy emphasis on drapery – i.e. a textural feature, as suggested in Geirhos et al. (2019) – in the detection of portraits, counter to the intuitive assumption that the most salient shared feature of portrait imagery would be found in faces.Applied to the ImageNet/ILSVRC2012 dataset the political dimension of these phenomenological biases becomes evident, where marginal image subjects heavily influence classification. To demonstrate this, we visualized and selected the output neurons for several classes of an InceptionV3 model (Szegedy et. al. 2016) pre-trained on ImageNet/ILSVRC2012 hand-selecting visualizations that show some non-intuitive properties of the ImageNet dataset.Fig. 1: Feature visualization allows for the discovery of unexpectedly salient image features. Here, a feature visualization of the “fence” class output neuron of an InceptionV3 deep convolutional neural network trained on the ILSVRC2012 dataset shows that, counter to intuition, the detection of fences is influenced by the presence of confined persons, an artifact of the training set. Importantly, this means that the presence of confined persons behind a fence in an image makes that image more fence-like to the classifier.For instance, for the “fence” class output neuron (fig. 1) we see that the network has not only picked up the general geometric structure of the fence but also the fact that many photos of fences in the original dataset (that was scraped from the Internet) seem to contain people confined behind these fences. This can be verified by analyzing the 1300 images in the dataset class, which indeed show some, but not many scenes of people confined behind fences. Cultural knowledge, more specifically, a concrete representation of cultural knowledge defined by the lense of stock photo databases and hobby photographers, is introduced here into a supposedly objective image classifier. Importantly, this also means that images of people behind fences will appear more fence-like to the classifier. The relevance of this consequence is revealed by a Google reverse image search: for a sample image (fig. 2) from the “fence class”, despite the prominence of the person compared to the actual fence, the search produces the Wikipedia entry for “chain-link fencing” (fig. 3), suggesting an unverifiable but likely connection between the Google image search algorithm and ImageNet/ILSVRC2012. Fig. 2. Sample image from the ILSVRC2012 “chain link fence” class. Note that there are only a few images (between 1% and 5% of the class, depending on what counts as “behind”) that show people behind fences. Fig. 3. A Google reverse image search for the selected image, despite the fact that it does not exist on the Internet anymore, and despite the prominence of the person compared to the actual fence, produces the Wikipedia entry for “chain-link fencing”, suggesting an unverifiable but likely connection between the Google image search algorithm and ImageNet/ILSVRC2012. A text search for “chain-link fencing” produces no “people behind fences” scenes.Finally, we propose a concrete analytical pipeline for the visual digital humanities that integrates visual analytics by means of open-source tools and frameworks. For instance, tools like summit (Hohman et al. 2019), lucid (https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid), or tf-explain (https://github.com/sicara/tf-explain/) combine feature visualization and attribution methods to enable a fine-grained analysis of how different neurons in a deep neural network contribute to the classification of an image based on its visual features. We discuss the feasibility of this proposed pipeline in regard to different data domains and computer vision approaches. We conclude that visual analytics could be integrated into many digital humanities projects, and will positively expand the results of future projects, making digital humanities research not only more rigorous but also increasing its scope.","offert@ucsb.edu, peter.bell@fau.de",Long Presentation

In the last decade, as digital humanities pedagogy has emerged as a coherent and visible discipline in its own right (Hirsch 2012), the requirement that “students need to develop their collaborative and interdisciplinary skills” has arisen as a central concern (Mahony and Pierazzo, 215).This poster describes the collaborative and project-based approach of our course, Digital Humanities in Practice, a forthcoming HarvardX MOOC (June 2020). Our aim is to embody the pedagogic ethic of “seamfulness” advocated by Mauro et al. in a recent special issue of DHQ, productively exposing the messy process of development. We do so in a number of different ways: 1) the course is team-taught by a scholar, a technologist, and a librarian to demonstrate the affordances and difficulties that arise when the instructors’ different competencies are knit together; 2) we encourage our students to make mistakes and we model doing so ourselves, so they can see how the progress of a digital project often does not follow a straight line, and 3) while the arc of the course draws the complete narrative of a digital project -- from corpus acquisition to publication and project maintenance -- the pedagogical patterns of the course reinforce the iterative nature of digital work.Project BackgroundIn his own research on eighteenth-century intellectual history, Stephen Osadetz assembled a team of computer technologists and librarians that created Open Books (conceptsearch.fas.harvard.edu), a concept-search engine for Gale's Eighteenth Century Collections Online database. Based on the success of this project, Osadetz and his team were asked to develop a practical course focused on text mining that embodies the collaborative nature of their work.Our team held a number of focus groups with students who had enrolled in the original course, and Cole Crawford conducted a survey of over 100 DH graduate certificate and degree-granting programs. The results indicated a substantial growth in residential DH programs at all levels over the past five years, but an almost complete absence of online DH instruction.Pedagogical MethodThe course walks students through each part of a text analysis project, from acquiring data through presenting results. Units follow a set rhythm, which is meant to ease students into each new skill. After a brief assignment and video to frame what is to be taught, each unit breaks into two substantial parts: one guided, in which students follow along with an instructional video in whatever platform we are using (Jupyter Notebook, OpenRefine, Tableau, etc.); and the other self-guided, in which they practice and extend what they have learned, individually and with peers through a discussion board. These second, more exploratory assignments (on, for example, metadata enrichment with Wikidata, or author attribution, or LDA) will be peer-assessed. A preliminary study suggests that peer grading and professors’ grading is highly correlated (Kaplan et al., 2014).ConclusionWe have attempted to turn these difficulties of creating a comprehensive course on digital methods to our advantage by designing a MOOC that embraces the ethics of seamfulness and collaboration, addressing itself to different types of audiences: scholars embarking on digital research projects, but also technologists and librarians who increasingly facilitate this work. We believe this course may satisfy a crucial need that may be appreciated by many people interested in DH but intimidated by coding: a playful but intellectually challenging introduction to the field that tells students, above all, that you don’t have to do everything on your own.","osadetz@fas.harvard.edu, cole_crawford@fas.harvard.edu, eslao@fas.harvard.edu",Poster

We created the Digital Scholarship Summer Research Fellows (DSSRF) program to broaden research opportunities for students and introduce them to new ways of engaging in scholarship. We drew on our previous experience working on digital scholarship and digital humanities projects at Bucknell, through which we had developed skills in GIS, text analysis, and data visualization, as well as our backgrounds as research and instruction librarians to inform the creation of DSSRF. The program operates on a cohort model, with students meeting as a group throughout the summer under the guidance of two librarians. The eight week program provides students with an opportunity to undertake independent research on a topic of their own choosing, and utilize digital humanities tools and methodologies to both answer questions and convey their research findings.Thus far, there has been limited research on the impact of digital humanities summer research or internship programs. Existing research on the impact of undergraduate research programs focuses on specific fields, e.g., the sciences (Lopatto, 2010). Through DSSRF, we have integrated informal assessment, both throughout the summer and at the conclusion of the program; with the 2019 cohort, we also conducted a more formalized assessment survey. However, these assessments only speak to the impact of the program in the moment, and do not provide any data on how the DSSRF experience impacts students in the months and years after they complete the program.We surveyed past Digital Scholarship Summer Research Fellows to understand how their participation and the skills they acquired were applicable to their subsequent coursework and career paths, and how the program influenced their thinking about scholarship.Some of what we hope to learn from our survey includes: If and how students put skills or tools learned in DSSRF to use in other contexts. Did participation in DSSRF influence future course selections, majors/minors, or their career trajectory? What research, presentation/public speaking, writing, and soft skills students developed by participating in an immersive research experience. Changes in the students’ understanding of digital humanities as a field. How did working with digital scholarship and digital humanities influence their thinking about scholarship more broadly?We plan to utilize what we learn through this assessment process to make changes to future iterations of the DSSRF program, with the goal of making the program a more holistic and student-centered experience. We hope that sharing this information with the broader digital humanities community will be informative to others facilitating or considering developing undergraduate summer research programs.","cpaddick@bloomu.edu, cmp016@bucknell.edu",Poster

Building upon long standing interdisciplinary thinking from the digital humanities and information engineering, Linked Art is an international collaboration across twenty-four institutions identifying focussed, practical models which meet their requirements on a sustainable basis.The central aim of Linked Art is the development and application of Linked Data to cultural heritage collections, with an emphasis on works of art and their provenance. Linked Data will provide the foundation for multi-modal digital scholarship across these rich collections; as an open data standard, Linked Art provides consistent, structured ways for arts institutions to publish art-related data where, in many cases, there has not been a consistent shared model to date.This panel presents a range of perspectives representative of the collaborative intersections found in the Linked Art community: with speakers from universities and art museums; who are practitioners and academics; on topics ranging from implementation, to curation, and research.The panel will takes the form of six position papers, outlined below, followed by questions and answers between the audience and panel. In doing so, Linked Art seeks to engage with the Digital Humanities community, building capacity for future collaborative implementations and research investigations.1. Linked Data and Open Data in Cultural HeritageEmmanuelle Delmas-Glass, The Yale Center for British Art, Yale University, USA.Cultural heritage institutions have a great deal to gain from deeply engaging in the networked environment. They have poured many resources in the digitization of their collections for the benefit of their audiences, from students to experts, who want to have access to more online material of a higher quality. The current landscape of cultural heritage knowledge on the Web, however, is very much siloed, which both harms the relevance of individual institutions as well as the overall state of scholarship which might use that knowledge.This paper reflects on the main challenges that cultural heritage institutions face when it comes to publishing their collections descriptions as Linked Open Data resources. Some challenges can be due to friction between a declared digital mission and the resources allocated, which might seem to be in competition with other institutional priorities. Other memory institutions are still in the process of understanding that managing their knowledge and data – so it can then be leveraged for the Semantic Web – needs to be a core data curation activity. It is also partly due to the lack of entry-level technology and ontology resources that has prevented museums from engaging more deeply with Linked Open Data.This talk will give an overview of previous initiatives and technologies intended to open up access to cultural heritage institutions, particularly art museums, including the International Council of Museums Committee for Documentation Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM, also an ISO standard); The American Art Collaborative (AAC); PHAROS, the International Consortium of Photo Archives; the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT); the Union List of Artist Names (ULAN); and the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).In the context of the successes and limitations of these efforts, this paper will outline the strategy taken by Linked Art, which is both a standard-based data model and a community, which has emerged from earlier work at the Getty Research Institute. This presentation will challenge the traditional paradigm which has large and wealthy institutions succeed in the face of structural challenges. In this era of hyper connectedness, the solution to museums’ relevance in the Web cannot be developed by a lone institution, and indeed the model that Linked Art promotes is instead based on inclusion with the goal to create institutional and individual partnerships. The other precept that the Linked Art data model advocates for is usability over absolute data completeness, and this talk will go over some specific data modeling principles that allow balance between the requirements of the institution, domain knowledge experts, technologists who will implement the standard, and scholars and other users of Linked Art.Emmanuelle Delmas-Glass is the Collections Data Manager at the Yale Center for British Art, a member of the IIIF Operating Committee, and co-chair of the Linked Art working group of the International Council of Museums’ Committee for Documentation (ICOM CIDOC). She oversees the creation, access to and distribution of the museum’s collections information and metadata, playing the lead role in ensuring the intellectual and technical integrity of the collections data and metadata.2. Conceptual models meet practice and scholarship: conventions, standards, and technologyKevin Page, Oxford e-Research Centre, University of Oxford, UK.The utility of a data model is dependent on its usage, and the context in which this use occurs. While conceptual models play an important role in providing a framework within which different data sets can be consistently represented and combined, in practice the resulting information structures can be perceived as complex or unwieldy, which can stifle adoption in cultural heritage institutions.Specialisms in scholarship and practice bring differing requirements and benefits to the structuring of collections data and its analysis, which are similarly defined by use – the operational needs of a collection or library are different from that of an exhibition, or of the intellectual needs of academic study. The challenge, then, is in respecting and encouraging these different ‘information perspectives’, whilst benefiting from their intersections where they occur, and managing the complexity of the systems and organisational implications. In addition, we recognise scholarship within cataloguing and curation activities, whilst appreciating these have different – but complementary – information needs and outputs from academic study of the collections. Digital tools and methods should reflect these activities, roles and specialisms, rather than constrain them. Doing so can ease adoption of digital approaches alongside existing established practice, increasing the sources of compatible structured information, and achieving overall progress through the combination of multiple information intersections.In considering the above, this paper reflects upon more nuanced notions of authority, standards, and how these are realised technologically; moving from necessary ‘on the wire’ interoperability to a progression from local practice, through emergent community conventions, to international standards bodies. It can be beneficial for different stages of maturity to exist simultaneously across distinct but complementary information structures, reflecting the communities of specialist practice and scholarship who are using the data. The technologies of Linked Open Data, including RDF and ontologies, provide a flexible foundation through which we can realise such an iterative and incremental approach to standardisation, and in which alternative information perspectives can co-exist.Linked Art recognises a further first-class perspective: that of the software developer writing (potentially for, or with scholars) applications which consume collection data provided by cultural heritage institutions. It adopts the principles of Linked Open Usable Data, as proposed by Rob Sanderson of the Getty Research Institute, to create a profile of the CIDOC CRM tailored to this information perspective, and in which established practice – for example, in the use of AAT – can be respected.Kevin Page is Associate Faculty at the University of Oxford e-Research Centre.

Practicing Linked Art: Evolving Art Data at the National Gallery of ArtDavid Beaudet, National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., USA.The National Gallery of Art (NGA) seeks to serve the United States in a national role by preserving, collecting, exhibiting, and fostering the understanding of works of art, at the highest possible museum and scholarly standards. As such, the institution is frequently engaged in activities that require production of the structured data describing our collection, the associated media, and writings related to the collection’s historical significance. These demands for data manifest in a variety of ways. Images are requested en masse, data sets are requested in support of research, and both data and media are increasingly requested in support of on-site and remote visitor experiences as well as for analytical purposes.In recognition of the need to automate the accurate publication of data about art, artists, depictions of art, and associated media, the NGA’s department of Analytics and Enterprise Architecture has been seeking data modeling and dissemination standards that are accepted by the cultural heritage art community in order to ensure the greatest reach possible from its automated art data services. The NGA has selected Linked Art as a strategic data standard.  Standardizing formats and exchanges of data through automated means has paid dividends for many industries in the past and continues to do so. For example, the IIIF standards[2] for image sharing have expanded the reach of deep zoom technologies and image collections across the cultural heritage sector and it is expanding into other communities[3]. Whilst data standards are not in themselves novel, no prevailing broadly adopted standard for modeling art data exists. Linked Art seeks to fill that gap.As part of its participation in the Linked Art community, the NGA is evolving an existing art data interface, one that currently provides collection data and images to its Conservation Space system, to use the Linked Art standards as a proof of concept. This paper will give details of that implementation, alongside the basics of the Linked Art model[4] - for representing artworks, people, and depiction. The evolving, open source[5], public-facing NGA interface already provides art data to a location-aware mobile app[6] available for visitors to download on their iOS devices, which will be demonstrated.A solution architect with the National Gallery of Art since 2005, David Beaudet designs and builds technical solutions for authoring and publishing rich art imagery, content, and metadata.

The Linked Art of Georgia O’Keeffe: Collections Across Institutional BoundariesSamantha Norling, Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields, Indianapolis, USA.The creation and publication of linked open data allows for previously siloed data to be connected with other related data on the Web, breaking down institutional barriers and facilitating research and new scholarship – in traditional and digital formats – that may not have previously been possible. With members and community participants representing over 20 different arts-related organizations, the Editorial Board for the developing Linked Art data model for describing art collections reflects this barrier-breaking nature of linked data.In order to showcase the connections that can be made when multiple institutions publish their collections data in a consistent format and utilize shared vocabularies, members of the Linked Art community collaborated to create a cross-institutional sample data set. The artist Georgia O’Keeffe was selected to serve as the common thread for the data to be contributed by participating institutions. With an emphasis on relationships, the linked data collected for the showcase naturally expanded to include not just O’Keeffe and her artworks, but also the works of her contemporaries, the exhibitions in which the artworks were exhibited, and the various organizations and individuals that had participated in provenance events in the lifecycle of the artworks.The development of the Linked Art O’Keeffe data set serendipitously coincided with the launch of the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum’s (GOKM) beta version of the GOKM’s Collections Online, which was built on a linked data foundation. The GOKM expressed the importance of linked data to their digital strategy to make it possible for “meaningful connections to be expressed across different types of collections (artworks, archival items, books, etc.) to establish a more complete understanding of Georgia O’Keeffe’s life, work, and contexts.”Drawing on both the GOKM’s Collections Online[7] and the co-constructed O’Keeffe showcase data set that is now available publicly within the Linked Art GitHub repository[8], this paper and panel presentation will explore the network of Linked Art data with Georgia O’Keeffe at the center. Following intersections between and connections across data sets, the exploration will follow a path through the many relationships identified that link artworks, archives, exhibitions, and people within O’Keefe’s linked data network. In discussing some of the specific relationships identified between institutional collections, the exploration will also highlight key patterns within the Linked Art data model. The Georgia O’Keeffe showcase data set, while small in scale, demonstrates the potential for the Linked Art data model to facilitate the creation of new connections between collections of all types – connections that cross institutional boundaries and facilitate scholarship at the intersections between GLAM collections.As Digital Collections Manager at the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields, Samantha Norling manages digital assets and data related to the museum's art, archival, and horticultural collections. A trained librarian and professional archivist working within an art museum, Samantha is particularly interested in digital projects that break down barriers between GLAM institutions. She is a member of the Linked Art Editorial Board.5. The History of Art is Linked but the Data Is Not: Georgia O’Keeffe, Provenance and ScholarshipLynn Rother, Leuphana Universität, Germany.The history of artworks is linked. They were produced by the same artists, traded by the same dealers, collected by the same people, transferred, looted or confiscated by the same entities while eventually finding their permanent home in the same museums – or not. To date, these links across museum collections are only visible to the few scholars or experts studying the artworks’ history of ownership. But the field of provenance research has matured enough to enable and support structuring and aggregating provenance records as Linked Data.Though shaped by complex and diverse contexts, an artwork’s provenance record can be broken down into empirical data consisting of objects, protagonists, dates, locations and types of transactions. To this day, however, the majority of museums record the valuable information harvested through time-consuming and resource-intensive provenance research within their collection management systems without machine-readable structure, hindering the analysis and linking of the data across institutions on a larger scale. Digital humanities tools offer the potential to standardize, aggregate, and consider the museum accumulated provenance data broadly to reveal new stories about the global circulation and displacement of artworks and nuance the existing histories of collecting and art market practices.As museum objects and their movements through time and space tell stories beyond object-based art historical research and collection cataloguing, this paper will elaborate on the potential of Linked Art for provenance research and for scholarship in related fields. The intertwined histories of selected works by the American Modern artist Georgia O’Keeffe – from different museum collections including the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico and The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York – will serve as an example.In particular, MoMA’s acquisition and deaccession of O’Keeffe’s Kachinas – representations of Pueblo and Hopi spirits used in ceremonies and rituals and therefore considered culturally sensitive objects in museum collections – will show how structured provenance data of museums using Linked Art can benefit related research fields such as the histories of collecting and art market practices but also museum, Native American, and Indigenous studies.Lynn Rother is the Lichtenberg-Professor for Provenance Studies at Leuphana Universität, Lüneburg, Germany, and a member of the Linked Art Editorial Board. Previously, Lynn was Senior Provenance Specialist at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, where she oversaw provenance research, procedures, documentation, digital strategies and funding in conjunction with all curatorial departments regarding works in the Collection, loans, acquisitions, and deaccessions.6. Topographia Helvetiae: Linked Art in SwitzerlandThomas Hänsli, University of Zurich / ETH Zurich, Switzerland.The historical view of Switzerland’s nature has been defined by artworks describing a ‘visual topography’ of the Alpine country long before the emergence of a broader touristic interest for Switzerland across Europe. Paintings, drawings, prints, and photographs depicting alpine landscapes, natural monuments, picturesque villages and much more shaped the perception of Swiss landscapes both nationwide and beyond.The Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (SARI) provides unified and mutual access to Swiss collection data, research data, and digitised visual resources from museums, archives, collections, as well as academic and public research institutes, based on a Linked Open Data network. Being part of a national research infrastructure programme, its mission is to combine the unique scholarly expertise from specialised research institutions beyond technical, linguistic, and institutional borders and to enhance the visibility and accessibility of Switzerland’s valuable collections and research resources.The aggregation and access of these visual resources is fundamental for browsing and understanding the evolution of the framing of Switzerland. The project »Bilder der Schweiz« (Views of Switzerland), developed under the aegis of SARI, provides a unique access point to topographic artworks and photographs from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century from major Swiss libraries, museums, and private collections. Starting from mass-printed, but hand-coloured vedute of the so-called ‘Schweizer Kleinmeister’ -- an affordable visual medium to propagate a canonised view of Switzerland that gained increased popularity over time -- the research portal includes related materials such as landscape paintings, drawings, printed textual sources, travel guides, travel journals, and further materials related to artist production, printing and marketing of printed ‘vedute’.The project will provide unified access to these heterogeneous materials from comparable, but technically different, institutional repositories following the Linked Art data model; and in doing so enhance public visibility of these little known, but widely consumed ‘Schweizer Kleinmeister’, and make them accessible to scholars.The project also provides an excellent test of the Linked Art framework’s flexibility, assessing the model’s ability to describe specific non-mainstream subject-based collections. This paper will reflect upon the overall transformation of a diverse selection of data sources into a Linked Art compliant format; with a specific focus on the advantages and drawbacks of the framework when describing tight semantic integration between the expression (the depicted visual apparatus) and the content (the perspective over the object). Finally, a reflection over the possible coexistence of multiple levels of description of an object, each level addressing specific communities, will be presented.Head of gta Digital (ETH Zurich, 2011) and director of the Swiss Art Research Infrastructure (University of Zurich, 2017), Thomas Hänsli has authored the strategy for a national research network and co-authored the development and implementation of comprehensive reference data models based on CIDOC-CRM.

While exploring the referenced materials may be non-linear, this is neither embodied in nor enabled by traditional communication mediums.  Previously we have digitally enhanced an extract of a musicological article with dynamic and interactive elements. Here, we introduce a tablet based interactive application which presents a comprehensive digital exploration as a companion to a complete musicological article. Taking the opera Lohengrin, the article and digital companion show how one motive is altered each time it recurs, reflecting its role in the drama, and exploring Wagner’s sophisticated treatment of recurring themes.

MELD traverses Linked Data graphs to select and filter relevant information, with reusable components for creating and retrieving annotations, and for displaying and interacting with musical, textual, graphical and audio-visual materials. MELD is written in Javascript and Python, with resources using standards including the MEI music encoding, TEI, the Music Ontology and Web Annotations. Figure 2: A view with labelled vocal score, text and translation.We provide two views for music notational content. Vocal score reductions are rendered from MEI with structural analysis dynamically overlaid; annotations trigger audio playback from that point. A second notational visualisation of MEI simplifies the complexity of a Wagnerian orchestral score: each instrument playing at a particular time is shown as a coloured ribbon, with the instrument's section of the orchestra providing the colour. This highlights differences across orchestration iterations that may seem identical as vocal score.Figure 3. The same iteration showing the orchestral summary view.For an opera thousands of bars long, overviews are crucial. An ever-present timeline shows all occurrences of a motive, providing a visual summary and a base for navigation. In the Time Machine view, users can also flick through motive occurrences – visualised as libretto, vocal score or orchestration – summarising the sequence within the opera, supporting quick comparisons, and as an index to detail views.","kevin.page@oerc.ox.ac.uk, david.lewis@oerc.ox.ac.uk, laurence.dreyfus@magd.ox.ac.uk",Poster

We propose text alignment as a way to empower the perception of the complexity of a language, but also as a method to leverage usual obstacles in the process of reading apparently “impenetrable” sources by directly engaging with them.

Since facts, unlike expressive content, are exempt from copyright, this project seeks to use machine learning approaches to evaluate how often expressive content appears in the first 20 pages of a given HathiTrust volume, with an eye to potentially making this data open. Information contained in the first 20 pages of a volume can be useful to scholars. For example, the title page, table of contents, or acknowledgment page may contain useful information to understanding the volume. However, it is likely that some volumes include materials that have copyright protection in this same range. Some observed copyrighted materials in this page range are illustrations or even the main text itself. One method to understand if expressive content is exposed in the first 20 pages would require manual page labeling, which is time-intensive. A machine learning approach is more efficient and could be well-suited to this type of prediction task, and we seek to answer these research questions: Can we develop a machine learning approach to help detect expressive contents in the first 20 pages of HathiTrust volumes? How reliably does this approach match manual labeling data?MethodologyProviding a high-quality dataset for training the machine learning model is essential, and human expertise is required. We manually sampled 900 volumes from HathiTrust and labeled each of the first 20 pages: either as 'factual' for a page with contents lacking creative expression and 'creative' if there is protected material on the page. Then we developed a workflow to use the statistical features of the page from the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) Extracted Features Dataset as additional data to train our model. The features used included: token and line counts, tokens per line, and begin and end line characters.Using the features above, we trained and compared four basic classification models on our feature set: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. Through this comparison we hope to both find the most accurate model as well as generally evaluate if a machine learning approach can be accurate for this task. The preliminary results of our prediction model can be seen in Figure 1.  Figure 1: Confusion Matrix for four models for predicting creative (protected) contentConclusion and Future WorkResults suggest that the Random Forest model performs best in both accuracy for predicting all labels (86%) and recall (0.88) for predicting creative content. For this project, we give more attention to the recall on the 'creative' label because a false negative on this label is a less desirable outcome. Future goals of this work are: to pilot different methods that can increase confidence in determining creative content, such as deep learning and utilizing page text, and to increase the scope of this prediction beyond our test set to a larger set of HathiTrust volumes.","nnp2@illinois.edu, keden@hathitrust.org, rdubnic2@illinois.edu, yuerong2@illinois.edu, jdownie@illinois.edu",Poster

The content contained in text corpora can be roughly summarized into five Ws, especially for biographies. In this research, we focus on spatial analysis and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to find two elements: “Where (Location)” and “When (Time)” in the biographical data. By linking and showing the extracted information via a GIS system, we built a spatiotemporal system for scholars to study historical issues from different perspectives.Research material and methodsMr. Chiang Ching-Kuo was a former president of the Republic of China. During his tenure, Taiwan enjoyed a long period of economic growth. The corpus we use is the Chronological History of Chiang Ching-Kuo (the Chronicle, henceforth) which was compiled by the Chiang Ching-Kuo Foundation. The Chronicle records Chiang’s life year by year, and the total number of characters exceeds 600,000. The numbers of characters for different periods are shown in Table 1.Table 1. Statistics for each volumeFigure 1 shows the three main steps of data processing, each of which will be explained below.Figure 1. Main steps in data processingData preprocessWe converted source texts that are stored as the MS Word files (Figure 2) into pure text files, and we extracted information about the daily activities and their time labels simultaneously.Figure 2. A page of the original materialData extractionWith the NLP techniques, we can capture the related information for future use. We employ the CKIP tools to segment words and extract the part-of-speech (POS) information. In the corpus, the POS label for the placenames is Nc, which is one of the important elements in spatial information. Figure 3 shows the statistics about the quantity of placenames of different lengths.Figure 3. Length distribution of Nc wordsIntegration processAfter extracting the placenames, we geocoded them. Since the Chronicle records events after 1910CE, the placenames are modern names. Therefore, we may use the Google Maps API for geocoding. By further combining the temporal information, the placenames can be shown on a temporal scale. Spatiotemporal SystemNext, we construct a WebGIS system that links statements in the Chronicle that mentioned the placenames in the GIS subsystem. To visualize the relevance of the corpus to spatial information, the system will show the corresponding original statements in Figure 4 when scholars click on the icons for the placenames in Figure 5.Figure 4. Original statements in the Chronicle for a chosen placename will be shown for reading. Figure 5. Placenames shown in the WebGIS system and can be clicked to queryFigure 6 shows an example, where the relevant statements were displayed on the left side of the interface. The map shows the spatial locations of the placenames. The time described by the text content is indicated in the timeline at the bottom of the system.Figure 6. An integration of time, place, and statements. Also, we provide an analysis of the frequency-time relation of placenames. It shows the year in which the placename appeared in the corpus and the frequencies of their appearances. In general, the more frequent a placename is mentioned in a particular period of the text, the more attention it should be paid to the place. Next, we use a practical example to illustrate how to analyze the text content through the system we have built.The construction of Central Cross-island Highway is an important achievement of Mr. Chiang. It is the first highway system that connects the west coast with the east coast of Taiwan. If we want to know the information about the highway in the corpus, we can find out the years of the relevant events by exploring the information of the placenames in our WebGIS and then by exploring the frequency of occurrence of the relevant placenames. There are three aspects to explore this study issue: spatial, temporal, and corpus information.Spatial information aspectFirst of all, we can move the scope of the inspection to a location near the highway through the spatial functions provided by our WebGIS. It will show the placename information related to the location. In this example, we can find information about placenames. It means that in this spatial range, these placenames are near the highway.Figure 7. Placenames near the Central Cross-island HighwayTemporal information aspectBy analyzing the frequency and time distribution of the placenames, shown in Figure 8. We may find that the peak frequency of the co-occurrence of these placenames falls between 1956 and 1962.Figure 8. The number of occurrences of placename and its years. With the spatial and temporal information derived from the previous analysis, we can find out the time period for the road construction and its effects. It can be seen from the text that the period from 1956 to 1962 was the time for the construction of the Central Cross-island Highway. The Tianxiang Scenic Area was established immediately, and the farms in Lishan were gradually developed. With the establishment of traffic routes, these locations along the highway became frequent visits by Mr. Chiang. As such, the researchers can read the statements in the Chronicle for specific times to learn about the relevant events.The aforementioned example shows that our system allows researchers to conduct a study by first identifying the relevant placesnames via our WebGIS interface. Our system links the placenames to the statements in the Chronicle. Since we have associated the statements with time labels, we could analyze the temporal distributions of the placenames. Naturally, researchers can read the statements on our WebGIS system on a temporal scale as well.ConclusionThe two elements of time and space play a very important role in the study of biographical data. Through NLP techniques and spatial information methods, we can extract important information from the corpora and build a spatiotemporal system. In this proposal, we illustrate an example of finding the time span for a specific event by analyzing the temporal frequencies of the placenames in the corpus. Researchers can discover the hidden information among the statements via our system. We believe that showing placenames on a GIS interface and relevant statements about the placenames on a time-related scale can provide helpful hints to complex research work.","yfpeng@gate.sinica.edu.tw, lingpai@gate.sinica.edu.tw, chaolin@g.nccu.edu.tw",Long Presentation

An administrative interface with accompanying curation scripts enables project participants to manage data about the manuscripts and letter examples, and allows investigators to identify new letter examples.Fig. 1: The DASH interactive scriptchart app, displaying the letter-in-context featureThe interactive online manuscript viewer and customizable scripchart generator developed for this project (accessible at dash.stanford.edu) enables scholars to select any or all of the available manuscripts and Syriac letter forms for inclusion in a dynamically generated scriptchart. The scriptchart interface provides options to display up to the top five most highly rated instances of each selected letter on each manuscript at multiple zoom levels, and to view the letters in an excerpted, binarized form or highlighted within their original context on the manuscript page, with a variably sized context window around each letter instance to allow examination of its connections to neighboring letters. The chart facilitates dynamic reordering and hiding of manuscript columns and letter rows, providing scholars with an efficient means to propose and evaluate alternative localizations and chronologies for letter forms and manuscripts. In addition, the interface includes a URL-based bookmark function so that a researcher can easily share a particular scriptchart configuration with others.The project source code is freely available on Github, and data regarding the coordinates of the identified letters on specific manuscript pages are available via an API endpoint. By agreement with the manuscripts’ host institutions, the interface also makes all manuscripts available for multi-up, zoomable viewing and navigation via embedded Mirador viewers that receive high-resolution images from the hosts’ servers using the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF).Fig. 2: Browsing multiple manuscripts in the DASH IIIF viewerThe database and interactive scriptcharts have facilitated studies of manuscripts that employ multiple classes of letters, with results that strongly suggest that the most typical way of classifying Syriac script as either exclusively Estrangela or Serto does not work particularly well for early manuscripts. Researchers also found that Estrangela letter forms were used as a “prestige” script and the frequency of their use showed a strong correlation with the genre of a given manuscript.Although the initial goal of the DASH project is to advance the understanding of Syriac Christianity, its larger contribution is providing a platform and a model for similar ventures in other languages such as Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Latin, and Sanskrit -- thereby positioning it at the crossroads of digital paleography.","mppenn@stanford.edu, vijoy@stanford.edu, scottbailey@stanford.edu, broadwell@stanford.edu, simonwiles@stanford.edu",Poster

We describe the theoretical basis and practical steps for a subject-oriented approach to this problem, examining data-related expectations through the lens of documentarity.In 1934, Belgian bibliographer Paul Otlet published a Treaty of documentation in which he outlined the “Aims of documentation”:“Universal as to their purpose; reliable and true; complete; fast; up to date; easy to obtain; collected in advance and ready to be communicated; made available to the greatest number of people.” (Otlet, 1934, p. 6)In 2016, the FAIR principles were published along similar lines:“To be Findable; to be Accessible; to be Interoperable; to be Reusable.” (Wilkinson et al., 2016, p. 4)They differ in some ways: Otlet viewed the Aims as a whole, with openness as a critical element, while FAIR is modular and not necessarily synonymous with open data. But more importantly, they both describe a plan which is meant to precede and guide implementation. Otlet’s Aims are broken down into goals related to the actual “biblio-technie” or “bibliothéconomie” (Otlet, 1934, pp. 372–375); similarly, each of the 4 components of FAIR is itself divided in 4 sub-components which delve into technical matters (e.g. data vs. metadata). These are actionable steps to be applied in the field, which is where trouble begins.During and after his time, close collaborators and distant peers alike noted the gap between Otlet’s ambitions and what he was able to achieve: Valère Darchambeau commented on “Mr. Otlet’s mental audacities, his utopias some would say” (Mundaneum archives, PP P0 462); Suzanne Briet called him ironically “the magus” of documentation. Indeed, he had a major impact on the institutionalization of documentation—the development of Library and information science (LIS) in Europe owes much to section 4 of his Treaty—but his work on the relationship between subject and knowledge was largely neglected. The techno-semiotic mediations of information have been far less studied in LIS than human ones; we can arguably trace this back to Otlet’s incomplete legacy. Conversely, the implementation of FAIR principles quickly raised the issues of user experience, expectations and metrics:“FAIRness is aspirational, yet the means of reaching it may be defined by increased adherence to measurable indicators . . . metrics that reflect the expectations of particular communities.” (Wilkinson et al., 2017, pp. 1–2)The interface between person and information seems much thinner for computer-held data than for library books. While this is not actually true (mediations have simply shifted towards human-computer interaction), it means that the feasibility of principles is challenged almost immediately by subjective experience. Data may be FAIR but people may differ: they do not all work on the same data or with the same mindset and therefore have different expectations. This shapes the way we assess data within the framework of documentation and therefore its value to us—its documentarity.Documentarity is the product of interdisciplinary theoretical work, at the intersection between ontology, documentation and linguistics. The first of these two influences have been studied: documentarity can be seen as a philosophy of evidence based on documentation (Day, 2019) and also as the quantifiable documentary quality of things, with applications to digital documents and data (Perret & Le Deuff, 2019). Here, we examine the third influence: how linguistics contribute to documentarity as an epistemological proposal which at the core focuses on the reception of information. We show that documentarity is linked to several works: Roman Jakobson’s “literaturnost”, which in French (“littérarité”) (Jakobson, 1977, p. 16) is very close to documentarity (“documentarité”); Hans Robert Jauss’ adaptation of horizons of expectation (“Erwartungshorizont”) to literature (Jauss, 1970); the shape of enunciation with Mary-Ann Caws “architexture” (Caws, 1981, p. 10) and Roger Laufer’s “scripturation” (Laufer, 1986, p. 75).This array of concepts is dense but its purpose is coherent: we draw from the phenomenology of the reading process to make better sense of the way we assess computer-held data. Our methodology is to track the embodiment of thought in technological mediations, especially in writing. The usefulness of such an approach has been described for the study of information as experience (Gorichanaz, 2017). We argue that the way we perceive the documentarity of data is shaped by our horizons of expectation, especially previous experience of genre-based rules which me must establish if we wish to prevent global principles from falling into abstraction as soon as they enter the field.In this perspective, digital notebooks form a stimulating case study, highly relevant to the conference’s theme on open data. They relate to a tradition and to new practices (data science, data papers). We analyze the way data is presented and interacted with in R, Python and Javascript-based notebooks, and we observe a reflexive impact on our perception of documentarity: it allows us to relate more practically to the intellectual framework behind Otlet’s “Aims of documentation” and the FAIR principles, which could improve their adoption. Through reproducibility and replicability, the practice of the notebook informs us on the relationship between data and truth. It also underlines the status of text as the most basic and universal type of data in science: the way text is handled in notebooks (lightweight markup languages, integration of standards, automation) shifts our perception of ‘text’ to ‘textual data’. This is independent from the field of study: we suggest that any research built from plain text can be considered a data paper and that extending “FAIRness” to scientific writing in general would be an epistemological breakthrough in scientific communication.","arthur.perret@u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr, oledeuff@gmail.com",Long Presentation

Nowadays, the Digital Humanities are beginning to gain greater public interest in Brazil and other countries in South America.In this perspective, our research would like to discuss what is produced in the Lusophone-speaking Digital Humanities in South America. The difficulty in diagnosing such production is evident because the global information regime has surrendered to the socio-technical and cultural monopoly mediated by Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft, major technological players (Fiormonte & Sordi, 2019). In the case of the Portuguese-speaking world, it is noticeable the language barrier often puts the debate and dialogue-less in evidence. In addition, English literature as it is evidently English-speaking escapes from the larger question of problematization in the face of critical thinking, which is decolonization.MethodologyThe present work came from the research data of Gomes et al (2018) that retrieved Digital Humanities academic papers, thesis, and books written in the Portuguese language from Google Scholar. Despite Google Scholar’s public access, it does not apparently provide consistent means that meet FAIR principles - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (Wilkinson, 2016), due to concentration and opacity of information retrieved, that it may be visible but not operable.This empirical study analyzed 454 abstracts which composed the textual corpus through text mining techniques with IRaMuTeQ - Interface ""R"" for Multidimensional Analysis of Texts and Questionnaires (Marchand & Ratinaud, 2012).Results The result of the similitude analysis (graph theory) unveiled possible thematic convergences of the Portuguese language production in the Digital Humanities. The graph showed a central cluster represented by the term digital, which has a semantic attraction with the following terms: conceito, texto, meio, ferramenta, linguagem, and interação. In addition, this cluster has two subclusters identified by artigo and processo, as well it links other opposing clusters: novo, estudo, and pesquisa. On the top right, the cluster novo has two subclusters social and nao. In the first subcluster, the term social presented a possible connection between the highlighted terms: comunicacao, informacao, social, and rede. The second subcluster demonstrated a balance between the terms: internet, possivel and acesso. On the bottom left, the cluster estudo exposed the term analisar in evidence, and it links to the cluster pesquisa which is on the extremity of the graph. From this analysis, it can infer the term set reflects actions, products, secondary research objects, and methods, besides the problems and challenges of non-internet access in the South.The word cloud allowed the quick visualization and identification of the main keywords of the textual corpus: digital, analisar, pesquisa, novo, comunicacao, pesquisa, tecnologia and nao. Furthermore, this result reinforced the perception of the similitude analysis.ConclusionsThe usual bibliometric retrieval based on Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus databases does not show the plethora of academic papers produced on Global South. From a decolonizing perspective, this study shows that scraping Google Scholar data could bring a broader result if you want to analyse portuguese scientific production. In addition, the use of Zenodo allowed the research result to have a visibility to the public outside Brazil allowing that the South American production could integrate Lusophone Digital Humanities in the global context, thus representing an important and necessary technopolitical action for researchers from that language community.","ricardopimenta@ibict.br, carvalho.priscila@gmail.com, josircg@gmail.com",Poster

Las administraciones públicas planifican exposiciones temporales de arte con fines políticos de propaganda o publicidad, de imagen, educativos o económicos. Cultura y política local van de la mano en las exposiciones temporales de arte por su carácter de servicio público, siendo muy considerada su labor de divulgación del patrimonio cultural ante la sociedad. Las administraciones públicas además del objetivo social persiguen otros objetivos, García-Mestanza y García-Revilla (2016) apuntan que el desarrollo de los museos en la ciudad de Málaga se debe a una estrategia de fomento del turismo cultural. Como en toda política pública se hace imprescindible la evaluación de las exposiciones temporales de arte, analizar si se han cumplido los objetivos cualitativos y cuantitativos señalados inicialmente, si los resultados obtenidos son los esperados o si el nivel de eficiencia en el empleo de medios y presupuesto es óptimo. Una de las tareas fundamentales en la evaluación de políticas públicas es establecer un sistema de indicadores adecuado para la evaluación. Los registros bibliográficos de la Biblioteca Nacional de España (BNE) sobre los catálogos de exposiciones temporales de arte publicados en España proporcionan datos para el análisis cuantitativo, cualitativo y relacional y favorecen estudios epistemológicos sobre el arte como constructo social y sobre las exposiciones temporales como las manifestaciones artísticas más lúdicas y populosas. BNElab es el proyecto digital de la BNE para apoyar la generación de nuevo conocimiento a partir de sus colecciones y datos. Una de las colecciones es la Bibliografía Española, que recoge los registros bibliográficos de los documentos publicados en España, recogidos por la BNE como depósito legal de los mismos.Los nombres de los autores de los textos, artistas, comisarios o curadores, instituciones, entidad que publica y ciudad donde se publica, tal y como aparecen en el archivo XML exportado desde el BNE, asociados entre sí, mediante relaciones de co-autoría y co-ocurrencia, constituyen un sistema, es decir, un conjunto de elementos interrelacionados que contribuyen ordenadamente a construir y caracterizar el sistema de conocimiento ""catálogos de exposiciones"". Este sistema se puede mapear y visualizar, tomando las relaciones sistémicas de asociación (autores, artistas, curadores, términos del tesauro del título del tema, género/formato y entidad editorial), según el método de análisis de similitud del software VOSviewer, metodología validada y empleada en estudios similares. Se han estudiado los sistemas de exposiciones temporales de arte de las ciudades españolas de Málaga y Valencia durante el periodo 2017-2019 según los registros del catálogo de la BNE. Los resultados indican que ambos sistemas de exposición se caracterizan por ser principalmente orientados y dirigidos por administraciones públicas y por una menor participación de las fundaciones o entidades privadas (ver figuras 1 y 2; redes de nodos con mínima ocurrencia igual a 1).

The Moravian Lives project (moravianlives.org), an international, collaborative DH project housed at Bucknell University, takes as its starting point a vast collection of archival materials held by the Moravian Church in the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States. The materials include tens of thousands of handwritten ego-documents, written in a variety of handwriting styles. As the documents are held in archives in a variety of international locations, one of the goals of the Moravian Lives Project is to digitize and transcribe these memoirs, to make them accessible to a broader audience.  Initially, transcriptions for the memoirs were crowdsourced. However, crowdsourcing is replete with problems including varying accuracy of transcriptions, length of time needed to produce transcriptions, and a dearth of individuals who can read the handwriting styles of the documents, particularly those written in old German script. To facilitate the transcription process, in early 2019 the Moravian Lives team began using Transkribus (transkribus.eu). The platform allows for creation of custom handwritten text recognition (HTR) models, which are based on previously transcribed memoirs and used to machine transcribe new documents (Muehlberger et al., 2019). With adequate training data (i.e., several hundred pages or 50,000+ words), models with a CER of five percent or less can be developed, which is sufficient for expediting archival work. Extant projects which have so far achieved this success rate may be based on multiple hands, drawing on significant data from each hand. For example, the University of Greifswald has trained successful models with a 5% CER on a corpus of 250,000 words written in three different hands. Similarly, the Bentham Project trained a highly accurate English-language model on 50,000 words written in a small number of hands (Muehlberger et al., 2019). The numerous and varying handwriting styles found in the Moravian memoirs present multi-facted challenges to creating highly accurate models. We do not know how many scribes there were, or in most cases their identities, and we are continually coming across new handwriting styles. Memoir documents are between two to 50 pages in length; most documents we are working with are 10 pages or fewer, meaning there is not a lot of data per document. While we have had some success creating models via human identification of similarities in handwriting, we believe that automated scribe identification and/or automated grouping of handwriting by similarities in style could result in much more accurate models. To address this problem, an undergraduate computer science major and professor of computer science joined the Moravian Lives team and are experimenting with deep learning to author a grouping model, designed to group or sort memoirs by handwriting styles. These groupings should enable the creation of more accurate models in Transkribus, as well as more accurate transcription outputs.

Queneau’s book is a collection of ten sonnets which verses can be freely recombined to form new poems. The book can be seen as composed of ten sheets, each separated into fourteen horizontal bands, each band carrying a verse on its front. The reader can choose, for each verse, one of the ten versions proposed by Queneau. The ten versions of each verse have the same scansion and rhyme, which ensures that each sonnet thus assembled is regular in shape [Queneau, 1961].It would be tempting to develop a computer-based version of Queneau’s work, but Queneau’s book is still under copyright, and it is by definition limited to its ten original sonnets. To overcome this problem, we developed the Oupoco project, aiming at proposing a sonnet generator based on the recombination of a large collection of 19th century French sonnets. The challenge is thus more complex than the one proposed originally by Queneau since our sonnets do not have the same scansion and rhyme. From this point of view, even if the project is intended to generate new sonnets, it is largely based on the development of analysis tools able to identify the scansion, the rhyme and the structure of the original sonnets. It is thus very different from the numerous projects dedicated to the pure generation of poetry, being with symbolic [Gervás, P., 2013] or neural methods [Ghazvininejad et al., 2017] [Van De Cruys, 2019] (among many others).Oupoco is currently based on a collection of 788 sonnets from 16 authors from the 19th century, and this database is regularly expanding. Each sonnet is encoded in a XML format along with related metadata, and a TEI version of the database is available. The project requires to get access to a formal representation of rhymes [Beaudouin, 2002]. In order to do this, the first step is to get a phonetic transcription of the last word of each verse, but this is not enough: for example, aimé and aimée have the same phonetic transcription, but do not rhyme, according to French rhyming rules (feminine and masculine do not rhyme according to the classical rules of French poetry); there are also cases where the phonetic transcription diverges but words actually rhyme (for example with sounds like [e] and [e]). A series of rules had thus to be defined to get a proper analysis of rhyme from the phonetic transcription of the last word of each verse. The generator uses this analysis to produce random sonnets, with different possible structures, respecting the rules of French versification (the code and the resources used, especially the sonnet database, are open source and freely available for research, see: https://github.com/clement-plancq/oupoco-api).A series of “side products” have been produced from the project, including:a website (https://oupoco.org/):Figure 1: Web page introducing the Oupoco websiteFigure 2: A generated poem, along with the constraint panel (on the left), allowing the user to select the authors and the structure of the poem he wants to generate. Placing the mouse on a given verse gives access to the exact reference of that verse.a bot posting on Twitter (https://twitter.com/oupoco_bot): Figure 3: The Oupoco bot on Twitter, generating a quatrain every 6 hours. and a “poetry box” (la boîte à poésie), a portable version of the original idea that can be demonstrated in public events (based on Raspberry Pi components). Through these devices our goal is to reach a wider audience and engage people to reconnect with poetry.Figure 4: « La Boîte à poésie », a portable version of the project, conceived Atelier Raffard-Roussel (Paris). This portable device allows one to demonstrate the system in various venues; the electric power required to generate a poem can be produced manually, thanks to the crank on the side.The main interest of the project is to present French poetry through a new and original setting. With our system, poetry is not any more just a literary genre [Derrida and Ronnel, 1980], but a dynamic object that can be manipulated and experienced. For lots of people, poetry is seen at best as something related to school years, at worse as something boring and uninteresting from the past. Our new setting, in itself, makes it possible to show that playing with poetry can be fun. Our setting puts in perspective the notion of text coherence [Reinhart, 1980], since the result of the generator can be more or less satisfactory from a semantic point of view.This has two consequences. The first one is related to interpretation: because the machine produces structurally impeccable sonnets, the experiencer is unconsciously encouraged to find coherence in them, simply because we are used to coherence in our everyday life and because incoherence is bewildering. The second consequence is a frequent need for the experiencer to go back to the original poem, to see where from a given verse originates (tooltips always allows the experiencer to go back to the original sonnet where a verse has been extracted). The project is thus not just a sacrilege game over venerated texts, but a way to make people experience and rediscover poetry.","thierry.poibeau@ens.fr, maignant.mylene@gmail.com, frederique.melanie@ens.fr, clement.plancq@ens.fr, raffard.roussel@gmail.com, sauratm@hotmail.fr",Short Presentation

My project demonstrates how artists’ archives benefit from non-traditional archival methods that combine emerging digital archival strategies that accommodate and represent community networks and collaborations with the intervention of the artists themselves in the co-creation of accessible multimedia archives. Digital methods will enable artists to augment and customize their archival holdings with attributes such as narratives/narration and networked information. The need to reconsider material and organizational aspects of artist fonds also has immediate and practical consequences for institutions. Often collections are broken up, and/or the acquisition process can be delayed by technical and policy-driven challenges. National funding opportunities, such as the Canada Council for the Art’s Digital Strategy Fund (DSF), add further incentive to the demand for fundamental procedural change. Archival scholars have identified two interrelated contentions underlying current approaches to artists’ archives within the present academic and archival milieu: systemic issues fundamental to archival conventions and practices, and shortcomings of formal organizational strategies within such practices. Feminist archival studies scholars such as Michelle Caswell, Marika Cifor, and Stacy Wood have identified that traditional archival practice is often rooted in colonial and patriarchal cultural and structural conditions. Engel and Wharton, scholars of artists’ archives, have addressed how the limitations of conventional archival systems often fail to accommodate the kinds of information, accuracy, and logistical affordances scholars and art professionals require for their research. Specialists in feminist archival studies respond to such organizational shortcomings, observing how the practice of the co-creation of archives with the artist(s) represented within the collections can contribute meaningfully to the value of the collection for scholars and communities. Caswell and Cifor’s proposal for a “feminist ethical framework” for archival studies situates the archive socially and culturally, with consideration of relational and affective contexts, and Cifor and Wood argue that “critical feminist theory can contribute to existing archival discourse and practice, critiquing concepts that have remained unquestioned, such as community and organization”. The addition of autobiographical, narrative, and networked data and digital media forms enable increased access, and have the potential to transform the relationships between artist, archival institution, and user. This paper explores two main, preliminary ideas: why a transformation of the organization of artist archives is timely and important; and how digital methods and platforms have the potential to benefit artists, arts scholars, and arts archivists. Potential Archives is both a study and a framework, providing both a map of how these non-traditional methods have worked in the past, and a model for how to develop future artist’s archives. My study and resulting framework will reconceptualize the interdisciplinary artist archive according to emerging feminist and digital epistemologies and methods to help artists plan for and prepare their future institutional archives and address emerging needs and concerns, while also assisting arts institutions in addressing such innovations.",jp03uw@brocku.ca,Short Presentation

Thus, translation sits at the intersection of cultures and of societies; no literature or culture exists in isolation, and the interaction between different literary systems is key to their evolution in time. Although this appears as common sense, it is a fact rarely acknowledged in literary histories, which still focus for the most part on national or, at least, linguistically homogeneous units of analysis. Taking into account the international dimension of literature and culture fosters a better understanding of the processes of cultural change, as translation is instrumental in the import of new ways of both thinking about literature and writing. This kind of approach is not uncommon in Translation Studies, however, it rarely focuses on mid to long-term patterns of change. Moreover, the underlying analysis is generally of a qualitative nature, focusing on literary agents and above all on the specific elements of repertoire that are being transferred and appropriated. Indeed, textual analysis is an indispensable component of such a study, and it yields fundamental insight into the particulars of the process of cultural change. It is, however, not the only tool at our disposal.Based on a corpus of translated texts published in Mexican cultural periodicals from 1894 to 1931, this paper assesses the contribution of quantitative methods to such an analysis. It stems from my doctoral research, which outlines the evolution of the functions and uses of translation in said corpus, seeking to examine Mexican literary history from a transnational perspective. More specifically, I argue that a data-driven approach can help identify broad trends in the production of translation, which can in turn help us substantiate or challenge conclusions drawn on the basis of particular case studies, and, as such, characterise cultural change over time.Periodical publications are fundamental for this kind of endeavour, as they are often considered as the most immediate format for intervention in public debate, including discussions around the concepts of literature and art. The fact that the magazines contain competing aesthetics and ideologies make them an ideal source for the study of cultural change. This is currently being addressed in what might become a new subfield of Translation Studies, as attested by the recent special issue of Translation and Interpreting Studies titled “Translation and/in Periodical Publications” and the Translation in Periodical Publications Conference organised by the MapModern project last year.[6] Various of the pieces presented in those instances contemplate diachronic evolutions (although not necessarily focusing on literary content), and some of them rely on a data-driven approach. However, this kind of research is very incipient, and we are still facing a lack of published studies on its methodological implications and possible results. In this context, I offer a comprehensive framework in which to approach literary translation published in periodicals, as well as a discussion of the usefulness of examining certain variables and challenges in doing so. This corresponds to the computational component of my doctoral research, which is nearing its completion. I believe that this kind of method can bring about important re-assessments and developments in literary history, especially in the Latin American context, in which these topics are hardly being addressed.The analysis itself consists of a variety of descriptive statistics run on a database which contains metadata for each of the translations published in a corpus of nearly 20 magazines between 1894 and 1931. The variables include the issue in which each text was published, its date, title, author, translator, genre, original publication date, original language, as well as its length, starting page, and the format of its signature, in an effort to consider both the symbolic and material aspects of the publication of translations. Information about the authors and translators (such as their gender, nationality and dates of birth and death) are also recorded.These different variables allow us to explore a considerable amount of questions, among which I have chosen to focus on the evolution of the original language of translated texts, as well as their author’s nationality, and original date of publication in order to outline the cultural geography and temporality of each periodical. It is indeed telling what the cultural references are at a given moment in time, and their proximity or distance in time is an important factor when assessing the role of translation as a source of innovation. One of the most expected evolutions, to give just one example, is that of the balance between translations from French and English, which progressively shifts from the predominance of the former to the latter during the studied time period, in a process of increased hemispheric dialogue and cultural exchange. Of course, such conclusions can (and should) then be refined by considering other variables in conjunction (e.g. is this evolution shared by various literary genres or not, does it go hand in hand with a change in temporality or no, etc).
In these different areas, my paper will emphasize the key role played by both data exploration and visualisation, and the usefulness of such an approach for literary history and Translation Studies alike.",marina.popea@mod-langs.ox.ac.uk,Long Presentation

Its trajectory is associated with the deepening and intensification of the use of information technologies in various areas of museums. The modern information environment has reached a high level of development, and users can now have many varied experiences online in order to engage with digital cultural heritage.It is very difficult to give a modern definition of the term “virtual museum”, since an updated definition of the term “museum” is still under development by ICOM. A group of experts working on a large European VIMM project gave the following definition of the concept of ""virtual museum"" as “a digital entity that draws on the characteristics of a museum, in order to complement, enhance, or augment the museum through personalization, interactivity, user experience and richness of content”.The digital history of virtual museums has been previously considered from different perspectives. Erkki Huhtamo’s article is noteworthy as leading the early history of virtual museums from the pre-digital era and changing the way they look at exhibition design. Paul L. Arthur approached the comprehension of the history of virtual museums from the point of view of the role and importance of interactivity, increasing the ability of the user to receive diverse experience in the online environment. It should be noted that the history of virtual museums has been formerly examined in a global context, while this work is devoted to the peculiarities of the history of virtual museums in the post-Soviet space.The focus of this study is virtual museums in the post-Soviet space, which includes the former Soviet republics that left the USSR after its collapse in 1991.The main source for studying the digital history of virtual museums has become the resources of web archives. The Museum.ru resource, snapshots of which are presented in WayBack Machine [4], has become an important source of information for studying Russian museum web space. The site was created as a platform for museums, allowing each museum to create its own web-museum resource with a wide range of capabilities. The specified aggregator contains statistics on such web resources, which is presented in the diagram (Fig. 1).It should be noted that the initial policy of this site was to provide space on the platform to any organization claiming to be a “virtual museum”. Until 2003 many private initiatives were placed there and they were not related to the GLAM industry. Since 2003, only web resources of actual existing museums of Russia have remained in the catalog (no statistics were available for 2000).As a result of the work on the project, the following main features of the history of virtual museums of the post-Soviet space can be highlighted:First, during the existence of the USSR, the experience of using information technologies in museums was limited to separate experiments of documenting individual collections (for example, the Hermitage developed an information system for data processing of antique art bronze and petroglyphs of Central Asia). With the collapse of the USSR, the globalization of the market in the post-Soviet space, and the widespread penetration of computers and software from Western countries, it was necessary to abandon partially the accumulated experience due to the technical incompatibility of Soviet technologies with the new foreign hardware and software. Whereas European and North-American countries actively used multimedia content, making it the central element of virtual museums online, in the post-Soviet space multimedia rarely went into the virtual space, firmly entrenched in the commercial sector with access to CDs.Secondly, since the beginning of the Internet era, non-profit and philantropic organizations that support and stimulate the development of this sector, in particular the non-profit partnership “Museum Automation and Information Technology” (ADIT), have been significant in the development of the museum environment. Non-governmental grant organizations support the community of museum professionals in the post-Soviet space, introducing innovations in museums and developing virtual museums. Among the countries studied, Russia has one of the leading positions in the development of a virtual museum space in technological and innovation terms.Thirdly, the representation of museum collections has gone from simple illustrations and museum narrative on exhibition topics to digital catalogs with a wide range of search possibilities, digital excursions and museum storytelling. An issue to note is the limited work with open licenses for the use of digital objects, which complicates the wider use of collections.Fourth, searches for the digital identity of virtual museums in different countries of the post-Soviet space, as well as an analysis of the visual images used, demonstrate a certain degree of dependence on the official political discourse. This is most acute in Russian and Ukrainian virtual museums of history, which showed a change of images after the events of 2014 and the aggravation of inter-state relations.In general, the digital history of the virtual museums of the former Soviet Union shows that the most advanced virtual museums have a long digital history, such as The Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts. The general level of virtual museums is significantly behind those globally in the quality of digitization, the methods of storytelling in web museums, and the creation of an audience-oriented digital content. At the same time, history shows that it is possible to adopt the positive experience of leading museums for effective further development.",povroznik.ng@gmail.com,Short Presentation

The H2020 SILKNOW project (Silk heritage in the Knowledge Society: from punched card to Big Data, Deep Learning and visual/tangible simulations) aims to produce an intelligent computational system in order to improve our understanding of European silk heritageThe SILKNOW platformThe poster introduces the scope and goals of the H2020 SILKNOW project and presents some of the functionalities offered by the online platform. The platform has been designed to freely and easily give access to a wide variety of aggregated datasets, describing silk-related artefacts produced in Europe between the 15th and the 19th century, and preserved in Cultural Heritage Institutions (CHIs) around the world.The definition of the SILKNOW ontologyThis computational system is modeled and trained thanks to datasets crawled by SILKNOW from online databases of CHIs, or provided by them. To aggregate these various datasets, it is necessary to harmonize them by designing and implementing a unique and complete data model. This data model is based on the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM). The classes and properties selected for the SILKNOW data model are publicly accessible and documented via OntoMe, an ontology management system, developed by the LARHRA research center (http://ontome.dataforhistory.org/). After evaluating the goodness of the ontology by providing mapping rules between CHI’s metadata records and the SILKNOW ontology, we observed that all fields can be represented by using existing classes and properties from the SILKNOW ontology so far. A CRM extension to describe the production process of silk artefacts CIDOC-CRM is also a core ontology with more specialist extensions. In other words, it is possible to add new subclasses and sub-properties to express more specific relationships and properties, without modifying the basic structure of the model.The complex modeling of the semantics included in data about the creative and productive process of silk textiles cannot accurately be mapped with the SILKNOW ontology. Free-text fields are generally used by CHIs to analyse the structure and the decoration of the fabrics, or to present the historical context of their production or their use. This first mapping aimed at storing these metadata “as they are”. The more complex modeling of the semantics included in data about the creative and productive process of silk textiles requires elaborating new classes and properties. There is yet no CRM extension for dealing with the production of textile artefacts, something similar to FRBRoo, for the creation, production and expression process in literature and the performing arts. We present the CRM extension we are currently elaborating for this purpose.

While misunderstanding and confusion abounds, there are few guidelines or training programs to help researchers pilot these waters. In “Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining,” we will highlight five essential legal literacies (copyright, licensing, privacy, ethics and policy, and special use cases (like international collaborations)) that TDM researchers can develop to confidently compile and publish text corpora. Our presentation will build on the research we have done in creating an NEH-funded, four-day Institute (https://buildinglltdm.org/) hosted at UC Berkeley in June of 2020. The focus of our work is United States law, with an eye toward cross-boundary research.Helping researchers and professionals build these literacies is essential for advancing knowledge in the humanities. In a recent study of the text analysis needs of humanities scholars (Green et al., 2016), participants noted that access to in-copyright texts was a “frequent obstacle” in their ability to select appropriate texts for data mining. The perception of legal obstacles does not just deter research; it biases research toward particular topics and sources of data. In response to content provider resistance, confusing license terms, and other perceived legal roadblocks, some researchers have gravitated to low-friction research questions and corpora to avoid decisions about rights-protected data. Yet their concern about working with copyrighted materials may be unfounded, as courts have found TDM methodologies that make use of copyright-protected texts to be fair uses.When researchers artificially limit their research scope to texts that do not have access restrictions, research may be skewed to leave important questions unanswered, and the resulting TDM findings are rendered less broadly applicable. A growing body of research also demonstrates how race, gender, and other biases found in openly available corpora have contributed to and exacerbated bias in the development of artificial intelligence tools (Barocas & Selbst, 2016, Larson et al., 2016; Levendowski, 2018). At the same time, DH scholars and professionals who exercise their fair use rights in conducting TDM research may inadvertently misinterpret the scope of those rights and other legal considerations that affect how they access, store, and disseminate rights-protected works. While fair use gives clear protection to the core activity of TDM analysis, copyright and other legal regimes may nevertheless limit the inputs and outputs of that activity in important ways. Undue caution leads to missed research opportunity, but undue confidence can lead to needless risk for the researcher and her institution.We have examined the legal contours of text data mining and identified five legal literacies for researchers and professional staff conducting or supporting TDM research. With an understanding of these literacies, researchers performing text data mining are better positioned to make legal and ethical decisions in building their corpora without fear. Currently, though, few trainings or resources integrate these legal literacies into DH TDM outreach and instruction. Moreover, our own experiences suggest that digital humanities scholars and professionals field many of the questions that arise around legal issues and TDM at the time of crisis (e.g., when university access to a database is suspended due to unlawful downloading). This places undue stress on one’s ability to conduct DH TDM research and may lead institutions to unduly restrict such research via policy.To address this gap, we created a four-day, NEH-funded institute, Building Legal Literacies for Text Data Mining (Building LLTDM), hosted by UC Berkeley during June 23-26, 2020. The goals of the Institute are to: (1) understand how law, policy, and risk management interact with digital humanities TDM projects; (2) integrate workflows for TDM research and professional support so participants can confidently pursue valuable research; (3) practice sharing their new tools and knowledge with others through exercises based on authentic consultations; (4) prototype plans for more broadly disseminating their knowledge; and (5) develop communities of practice and coordinate, where practicable, cross-institutional outreach about the TDM legal landscape. To maximize impact, all instructional materials (including sample lesson plans and exercises) will be shared publicly as a CC0 (Creative Commons Zero waiver) open educational resource (OER). This hands-on curriculum supports 32 participants (16 DH researchers and 16 professional DH support staff including librarians) and will be taught by a combination of experienced legal scholars, librarians, and researchers—all of whom are immersed in these subject literacies and workflows.Our DH2020 presentation will elucidate these five legal literacies with reference to common DH use cases. We will also reflect lightly on the institute model and its efficacy for helping DH scholars and professionals confidently chart a course forward. Through the legal literacies we have developed, text data mining researchers are better positioned to make legal and ethical decisions in building their corpora with confidence.","sreardon@berkeley.edu, rsamberg@berkeley.edu, gworthey@illinois.edu",Long Presentation
"Rebora, Simone (1,2); Lendvai, Piroska (1); Kuijpers, Moniek (1)",1: University of Basel; 2: University of Verona,Annotating Reader Absorption,"Reader absorption, Social reading, Inter-annotator agreement, Machine learning","Global, English, Contemporary, annotation structures, systems, and methods, text mining and analysis, Literary studies, Sociology",English,Global,Contemporary,"annotation structures, systems, and methods, text mining and analysis","Literary studies, Sociology","This paper presents our approach and interim results of the “Mining Goodreads” project, aimed at developing a computational approach to measure feelings of absorption in user-generated book reviews in English. Story world absorption is an experiential state driven by the reader's mental construction of a fictional world. Kuijpers (2014) proposed a theorization of story world absorption, distinguishing its four main dimensions: Attention (focused attention on the text, reducing awareness of the self and the passing of time), Transportation (the feeling of being transported to the story world), Emotional Engagement, and Mental Imagery. Kuijpers et al. (2014) developed and validated a corresponding questionnaire composed of 18 statements (Story World Absorption Scale, SWAS), which was already used in a series of studies on reader response (e.g., Hartung et al., 2017; Balint, Kuijpers & Doicaru, 2017; Kuzmicova et al., 2017).Rebora et al. (2018) showed its application in DH research: manual analysis of 180 reviews published on Goodreads, one of the most popular “social reading” platforms (Cordón-García et al., 2013), indicated the utility of the SWAS in mining online book reviews for mentions of absorbing reading experiences. Multiple sentences of the Goodreads reviews show semantic and conceptual similarities with the 18 SWAS statements. Our experiments with software for text reuse detection and textual entailment recognition indicated the need for improved quality and quantity of manual annotations to be used as training data.Therefore, in our current project, funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation in the “Digital Lives” program (grant nr. 10DL15_183194), we pursue two aims based on labeled data obtained from five trained annotators: (1) data-driven validation of SWAS through confrontation with idiosyncratic, unstructured texts in which people describe their reading experiences; (2) development of an annotated corpus for training machine learning classifiers to detect different levels of absorption in millions of reviews hosted on social reading platforms.So far, eight annotation rounds were completed on a total of 890 reviews, using the Brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012) and INCEpTION (Klie et al., 2018) annotation tools on fully flexible spans of text tokens. In the first round, we used six labels: SWAS_specific, for sentences that show direct similarity with the SWAS statements; SWAS_related, for sentences not included in the SWAS, but listed in a wider taxonomy of reading absorption (Bálint et al., 2016); mention_SWAS, for mentions of the SWAS concepts without reference to the actual reading experience of the user who wrote the review (i.e., “usually when I read a book, I like to be able to fully imagine what the world of the story looks like”); and candidate for unclassifiable, potentially relevant absorption phenomena. The first two labels also had a Present/Absent flag, for signaling sentences that explicitly confirm or negate absorption concepts. In the following rounds, these labels were extended to up to 145 tags, allowing to mark up more fine grained phenomena, like the four dimensions of story world absorption (Attention, Transportation, Emotional Engagement, Mental Imagery).Inter-annotator agreement varies substantially depending on the labels. Figure 1 shows the evolution of Krippendorff’s Alpha for the main tags in the eight rounds. As evident, there is a slight but steady improvement throughout the annotation process, that can be verified via the evolution of the “mean” and “all” scores: “mean” indicates the mean of the alpha scores for all of the tags (as it was not possible to calculate a single alpha score, because different tags could be assigned to the same sentences); “all” indicates the alpha score for a unique tag, obtained by checking if the sentence was annotated or not, independently from the assigned tag. In both cases, values move from fair (~0.2/0.4) to substantial agreement (~0.6/0.7). Among the high-level tags, SWAS_related_PRESENT reaches the highest values, while mention_SWAS_PRESENT scores the lowest, confirming the difficulty in recognizing absorption when no experiences of the I are mentioned.Figure 1. Inter-annotator agreement for the eight rounds of annotation. Alpha scores were calculated on a sentence basis (sentences split using spaCy) Curation is currently in progress. However, first results confirm the already-observed trends. Mean agreement with the curator (mean Cohen’s Kappa for the “all” tag) was 0.55 for the first round, while it reached 0.68 for the fourth.The annotated segments offer the possibility to explore the different linguistic choices of reviewers. Figure 2 shows already some clear distinctions: verbs like “wait” and “want” and general references to the reading experience dominate the SWAS_related area. On the other hand, terms like “felt”, “characters”, and “story” indicate the stronger focus of the SWAS on personal involvement in the story world. These outcomes provide valuable information for validation and future development of the SWAS. To confirm these findings, we used log-likelihood tests and compared the annotated texts with 100,000 randomly-selected reviews. Figure 3 confirms the dominance of emotional states in the SWAS_specific area, while SWAS_related terms like “wait”, “next”, “edge” and “seat” signal the frequent repetition of expressions of anticipation such as: “I cannot wait to read the next book in the series” and “I was on the edge of my seat”. Figure 2. Comparative word cloud based on the most frequently annotated words (SWAS_specific_PRESENT vs. SWAS_related_PRESENT annotations). Figure 3. Overrepresented words in the annotated passages (SWAS_specific_PRESENT and SWAS_related_PRESENT annotations). Log likelihood calculated with the Quanteda R package. Focusing on the four SWAS dimensions, distinctions become even more fine grained. Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate for example how the phenomenon of Attention stimulates the widest reflections on the reading experience (e.g., on how “hooking” and “captivating” it can be). Transportation and Emotional Engagement partly share the keyword “felt”: however, in the first case it means a more cognitively-aware “experiencing” of the fictional world, while in the second it relates to the deepest personal feelings (with a slight dominance of the negative over the positive). Mental Imagery shows at the same time the widest selection of words (cf. Figure 4) and its lowest distinctiveness (cf. Figure 5), confirming the lower presence and definition of the phenomenon in the Goodreads reviews. Figure 4. Comparative word cloud of most frequently annotated words (four SWAS dimensions). Figure 5. Overrepresented words in the annotated passages (four SWAS dimensions). Log likelihood calculated with the Quanteda R package. With the aim of extending the analysis on a much wider corpus, we used several state of the art machine learning approaches to train a binary classifier on the annotated reviews, cf. (Lendvai et al. 2020). When the current full dataset became available for training, a fine-tuned version of BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) reached 0.63 F-score on the target class, i.e., detecting absorption statements, and a linear regression model stacked on BERT predictions reached a mean average error of 0.08, cf. (Lendvai, Reichel, et al. 2020). These results strongly suggest that we can automate the annotation task in the future. With reference to the conference theme, our research shows: (1) the utility of human agreement studies before the building of tools for DH; (2) the urge that computational literary studies move their attention towards the open and polyvocal treasure trove of information provided by social reading platforms (cf.

Salzani & Tötösy de Zepetnek, 2010; Belgum et al., 2018). The Travelogues project aims to study what we can learn from past views of foreign regions, cultures and religions in the light of present-day challenges such as mass tourism, migration and globalization. Comprising a team of historians, librarians and data scientists, Travelogues applies a transdisciplinary approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analytical methods to study a large-scale corpus of German language travelogues.The project focuses on German-language holdings of the Austrian National Library printed between 1500 and 1876, including 167,570 digitized volumes. Those volumes have previously been digitized and processed by Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the Austrian Books Online project—a public-private partnership of the Library and Google Books. In order to facilitate analysis of this vast and heterogenous collection, the project faces a number of challenges. The first challenge is to compile a corpus that includes as many travelogues from the inventory as possible. The second challenge is the profiling of the corpus at scale, analyzing it specifically for aspects of geographical coverage, salient terms over time and intertextuality. Finally, the key challenge lies in the identification of depictions of otherness in the corpus, and evolution of those depictions over time.Travelogues is a work in progress. In this paper we will describe our results so far—how we created the corpus and approached the task of profiling—and present our plans for the upcoming steps required for a detailed analysis of the corpus.As the intellectual basis for the project, historians first established a definition for this project’s use of the term travelogue. In the context of the project, a travelogue is defined as a specific form of media that records the experiences of a factually undertaken journey. Applying this definition, we created a balanced ground truth of digitized travelogues and non-travelogues (works that could belong to any other genre). To account for variations in the data such as document length, OCR quality or orthographic differences, we created separate ground-truth datasets for different time periods: the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries and 1800–1876. This is a manual and time-consuming process involving several steps, including keyword and metadata searches of the collection, cleansing and enrichment of heterogeneous metadata and comparisons with both contemporary and modern travelogue bibliographies (e.g. Chatzipanagioti-Sangmeister, 2006; Griep & Luber, 1990; Treue, 2014; Yerasimos, 1991). Every book we identified using this method was independently verified by a historian and a librarian.Based on the ground truth for each period, we trained and evaluated different machine learning algorithms to classify works as either travelogues or non-travelogues. This evaluation was done using five-fold cross-evaluation on a training set and a validation set. Using the best-performing approach, we applied the models for each time period and classified all documents not part of the ground truth (a total of 161,522 books). Our model returned a confidence score, essentially quantifying the likelihood that a given document is or includes a travelogue. The top 200 findings for each time period (800 in total) were then manually evaluated by our domain experts in order to confirm the validity of the automated results. Our process revealed 345 previously-unknown volumes of travelogues that were not listed as travelogues in any  bibliography we consulted so far, nor could they be found using conventional metadata search methods (e.g. searching for different spelling variations of the German word for travel). Although the 345 newly-discovered travelogues did not noticeably differ in their content from the previously-known canon, their materiality was particular. A large number of them were originally published as part of larger documents (such as serial publications, collected volumes or diaries) that, due to the lack of metadata in the library system, usually cannot be found with the traditional methods of the humanities as described above. Although we did not segment the documents into smaller entities (e.g. pages or chapters) for classification (Underwood et al., 2013), this shows that our methodology leads to robust results concerning documents that are only partially considered part of a genre, as in our case with travelogues. Additionally, we successfully proved that our methodology can expand traditio­nal bibliographic research and help save time for domain experts. We have already described our classification task in detail (Rörden et al., 2020). Our next steps concern the analysis and historical contextualization of the corpus. We are currently creating a searchable index of the entire document inventory (travelogues as well as non-travelogues) to enable exploratory searches. Key exploration scenarios include plotting the number of travelogues published over time, optionally while filtering by various facets (such as authors, publishers, keywords or catalogue subject classifications); and exploring salient terms that feature more prominently in travelogues over non-travelogues, or in travelogues of a particular period vs. in those of another. We have also begun to generate maps of travelogues’ geographical coverage by performing Named Entity Recognition, and resolving coordinates against the GeoNames gazetteer. Furthermore, we have taken the first steps to analyze intertextual relations between documents (e.g. Dörr & Kurwinkel, 2014; Rajewsky, 2002), experimenting with a mix of approaches including n-gram fingerprinting (c.f. Stein, 2007) and paragraph vectors for document representation (Le & Mikolov, 2014). This has been combined with clustering and text passage alignment using the BLAST-based text reuse algorithm developed by Vierthaler and Gelein (2019). By applying the algorithm corpus-wide, we hope to learn more about the relationships between the documents and their authors, as well as how descriptions of and references to people, places and customs propagate through literature over extended time periods. Preliminary results seem promising, and have revealed what appear to be potential candidate cases of previously undocumented text-reuse. However, deeper analysis of the candidates and refinement of the methods are still ongoing. This method for the detection of intertextual relations is also a promising tool for clustering and relating works, not only based on literal title-strings but also on indexed full-texts, thus following the suggested implementation of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions Library Reference Model (IFLA LRM) into library catalogs (Decourselle et al., 2015; Rafferty 2015; Riva et al., 2017). With our method, we were able to create the largest curated corpus of German-language travelogues to date—3,595 volumes, 345 of which were, to the best of our knowledge, not previously identified or findable as travelogues—thus proving that methods like ours can successfully expand the classic bibliographic methodology of the humanities and library sciences. We have made first steps towards enabling the interactive exploration of a number of relevant properties of the corpus. The next year will be dedicated to addressing the main research goals: the identification of intertextual relations between the travelogues in our corpus to deepen our understanding of how they depended on each other, and what this tells us about the circulation of knowledge, stereotypes and prejudices. This will ultimately lead to the question of how notions of otherness were depicted, how and why they changed over time, and what conclusions this allows concerning today’s perceptions and biases. We have already published large parts of our corpus under a Creative Commons license. Beyond the goals of our own project, we feel that the open availability of the corpus marks a significant contribution to the research community at large, and will invite further scholarship and collaboration around this exciting resource.","jan.roerden@ait.ac.at, rainer.simon@ait.ac.at, doris.gruber@oeaw.ac.at, martin.krickl@onb.ac.at, bernhard.haslhofer@ait.ac.at",Short Presentation

We examine why even after several years of academic inquiry DH leaves a faint footprint on humanistic and public-facing scholarship in India. The four papers in this panel will look at the intersections of philosophy, theory, pedagogy and practice: to conceptualize a postcolonial DH in India using examples of particular projects as case studies. Together the papers in this panel explore the possibilities of Digital Humanities in India along with its concomitant challenges—including technological, structural, institutional disparities as well as issues of access and mobility—and reimagines the potential for developing a decolonized praxis for Digital Humanities in the Global South.No “Making”, Not Now: A Distant Reading of Digital Humanities in IndiaDr. Dibyadyuti Roy (Indian Institute of Management, Indore) and Dr. Nirmala Menon (Indian Institute of Technology, Indore)The emergence of universities and postsecondary education in India from a colonial system that was “set up primarily for conducting examinations and awarding degrees, and not for undertaking research or even teaching” (Beteille para 2) has resulted in a system some have termed an educational apartheid: developing and sustaining the “ominous social pressure: [of]the idea that good students study science. Studying humanities is frowned upon as intellectually demeaning” (Gangopadhyay para 4). This ensures majority of public funding for research is pumped into the STEM fields while the Humanities have to make do with the crumbs. This in turn means that Humanities departments in universities often cannot even access disciplinary innovations in DH theories, methodologies and tools, let alone advanced training for faculty members. Therefore, the contextual relevance of the “making” versus “talking” debate raging across Anglo-American DH sites withers away in postcolonial spaces like India where DH, at least not yet, is not a term of “tactical convenience’ (Kirschenbaum)In acknowledging this ontological premise, our intervention tries to locate the inaugural Digital Humanities Alliance of India (DHAI) Conference in June 2018 within an epistemic genealogy of South Asian and more specifically Indian Digital Humanities interventions, which may act as a primer for envisioning the future of postcolonial and indeed Global Digital Humanities. We consider some of the reasons for the resistance to institutionalizing digital humanities within the larger university systems in India and conclude that the causes are historical but also perhaps the embedded rigidity and regimentation of university-curricula across disciplines. Digital Humanities, as defined by its purported inter- or transdisciplinary character, becomes a tough sell within Indian university ecosystems, often constrained by their colonial origins and the limitations of a postcolonial social imaginary. By highlighting key issues regarding digital affordances in postcolonial contexts and exemplifying digital humanities projects thatwere presented at the DHAI 2018 conference, along with representative digital interventionsbeyond the conference's ambit, we conduct what we may term a ‘distant reading’ of the digital humanities in India. In conclusion, we suggest the need for a postcolonial digital humanities that is deeply invested in cross-disciplinary exchanges and pedagogical innovation: one that interrogates hegemonic assumptions about both “Postcolonialism” and “Digital Humanities.”Do Postcolonial Intersections Matter?Critical Epistemological Approaches to Digital Humanities and Mobility Studies in IndiaDr. Mayurakshi Chaudhuri and Dr. Chiranjoy Chattopadhyay (Indian Institute of Technology, Jodhpur)“Postcolonial theory” evidently is not a singular theoretical framework, but rather an interrelated set of critical and counterintuitive perspectives, including a complex network of interconnected concepts and heterogeneous practices that have been developed out of traditions of resistance to global historical trajectories of imperialism and colonialism (McLeod 2007). Furthermore, such counterintuitive perspectives and inquiry have undergone immense transformation by the digital revolution of the twenty-first century which has redefined relationships with and within the society, as well as sociological approaches to its analysis and interpretation in response to historical transformations over the past decades. A fundamental question remains as a natural corollary: How should this inquiry change with newer visibilities in the future, particularly for “digital humanists”? To examine these new challenges, we turn to an unavoidable global fact, omnipresent in historical and in contemporary times: human mobility. While sociological theorizing about mobility during the last quarter of the twentieth century was dominated by questions of relationship between mobility and neo-Western ideas of modernity (Sheller and Urry 2016), there has been a shift in discourse since the last decades with the advent of the digital revolution where postcolonial discourses have been re-crafting the very definition and production of mobility (for example, tourist sites).However, while research on mobility studies over the decades have included objects of development whose actions are structurally determined, to cultural subjects across the continuum, one consistent truth has been that their experiences of structure, agency, and identity negotiations are inflected by gender, race, ethnicity, class, religion, sexuality and nationality, to name a few of the axes of differentiations. With this in background, this article seeks to bring from the periphery to the core the multiple connections between mobility, intersectionality, the colonial past and postcolonial dynamics particularly impacting Public Digital Humanities in India. Not surprisingly, prolonged realities of colonialism have produced historical and cultural consequences that remain integral to hegemonic mobility and contemporary lifestyles in India,and these axes of differentiations have had very long, contested historical roots (Loomba 1998).For example, European colonialism in South-, Southeast- or East Asia, required, and made possible, inequalities of power that pivoted around apparently real yet ultimately imagined gender differences between the colonizers and the colonized, that gets manifested across societal and digital spaces. Therefore, examining mobility within the framework of postcolonial histories in India thus brings us to an important hinge between distant times and places – the linking is historical, cultural, material, and digital (Chaudhuri and Thimm 2018). Everyday negotiations of such mobility explicitly point to these pressure-points and movements across multiple geographic and social scales where the axes of differentiations are constantly negotiated and redefined. This opens up a plethora of questions that need immediate attention: (1) How are such postcolonial mobility scales (local, regional, national, digital) re-constructed? (2) How do these postcolonial scales inflect and are inflected by the various axes of differentiations; and most importantly, (3) How have these negotiations inflected postcolonial realities of mobility and lifestyles in digital India? That is, how are the new visibilities of postcolonial realities crafted?This paper includes broader debates of these new visibilities of postcolonial experiences and lifestyles and en route, reflect on the importance of theorizing social position, power relations, individual’s identities, and their accompanied complexities in understanding emerging postcolonial patterns that inform, influence, and even inflect epistemologies of Public Digital Humanities in India.Visualizing the Cultural History of South AsiaDr. Arjun Ghosh (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi)The history of the various literary and artistic forms have hitherto been written by the close study of the works and activities of individuals or artistic movements. Even though such methods – qualitative in character – have produced authoritative histories, they have relied on the human ability to read and correlate texts. The computational turn makes it possible, through large datasets, to support as well as put to test readings by the “human eye”. Schich et al used crowdsourced data of birth and death dates and locations to study patterns of migration of notable people across history in Europe and North America (Schich et al. 2014). Schich et al. sourced their data from Freebase, a crowdsourced database of notable people and things, the Getty Union of Artist Names and other sources.In this project we visualize the data for South Asia to look at patterns of migration. In order to update the data used by Schich et al. we supplement it with data from Wikipedia biographies. The most influential persons from the Wikipedia data is extracted using a filter for pagevisit statistics of the particular Wikipage. From Wikipedia we can build a bigger dataset that includes birth and death data for people from different sectors of society. We map this data to reveal the different locations which acquire importance in different sectors across the 19th and 20th centuries. While migration studies relying on census and other macro level data concentrates on studying the migration patterns for labour and skilled workforce in various industrial sectors(Dupont 2000, Abhishek et al. 2017), working through crowdsourced data allows us to identify the changing patterns of migration among artists and creative persons, administrators, sports people, academicians and scientists and other elite sections of the population. Our analysis reveals that the erstwhile colonial capital Calcutta started losing importance as a cultural hub in the 1950s and 60s when a large number of artists from the western Punjab settled in Bombay. In recent years the southern cities of Chennai and Bangalore has been growing in attractiveness for artists in Southern India. Pune has also grown in attraction for artists and academicians in comparison to Mumbai. While different urban centres have changed positions as hubs for different sectors, Delhi has grown as an attractive settlement across sectors since the 1990s.Creating Digital Archives in India: The Public's RecordDr.Maya Dodd (FLAME University)In an attempt to challenge the inscrutability of the state, the Right to Information (RTI) Act of 2005 has been critical in creating a public record and making government information visible to India’s citizens. It is no coincidence that such a right was not only a function of democratic maturity but also a function of technological possibility. Without oversimplifying the point about transparency and accountability, the ease that digital access has granted in making an RTI request assumes the existence and possibility of digital archives for civic convenience. Since such archives are often being created at the time of the ask, the creation of digital registers of information is essentially a collaborative effort.Sites like governmentdata.gov and citizen led efforts like open data meets are both enabling thecreation of parallel registers and repositories that often contest or carry forward the digital data sets of governance. Similarly, in the case of public history, in addition to officially sanctioned preservation projects, citizen led and crowdsourced efforts to populate public records are enabled by digital media. Thus, we see portals like the People’s Archive of Rural India (PARI) and theIndian Memory Project that are both a function of the digital medium as well as a product of a new democratic impulse to arrange information publicly. Understanding how these crowdsourced contributions multiply public records and further the cause of digital access can lead to insights in participatory governance and enhancing the public’s access to the workings of the Indian state. When placed alongside other efforts to create digital archives (institutional archives, digital news and online museums for instance) the shift this indicates for public culture bears great promise for multiplying points of view, so necessary to a successful democracy.","dibyadyutir@iimidr.ac.in, nmenon@iiti.ac.in, maya@flame.edu.in, arjunghosh@hss.iitd.ac.in, mchaudhuri@iitj.ac.in, chiranjoy@iitj.ac.in",Panel

Catalogue entries are often inconsistent, in plain text, and without geographic coordinates (much less coordinates linked to authority records). Georesolution of the relevant fields (by matching text strings to citable external resources which do have spatial coordinates) makes catalogue data machine-readable and allows collection exploration that more fully takes the geographic dimension of metadata into account.Geographic metadata analysis requires a very high-quality resolution of the relevant metadata fields. However, georeferencing by hand is highly time-consuming, and both state-of-the-art georesolution systems and off-the-shelf geocoders achieve highly varying performance depending on the datasets they are applied to (Gritta 2019, DeLozier 2015, Alex 2015). Here, we propose a strategy to resolve place names in metadata that uses an active learning method based on heterogeneous uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Catlett 1994). This method, which we call “smart annotation” (because it depends on selective human feedback), significantly reduces the number of manual annotations by actively querying the user only for less certain matches. We applied this method to the British Library (BL) newspaper title catalogue and obtained 25,000 high-quality georeferenced records in less than three hours.The value of geographic newspaper metadataThe BL holds about 37,000 newspaper titles, of which 25,000 are from inside the UK and Ireland. BL newspaper titles are catalogued with geographic metadata in plain text, including country, county, and city. This metadata does not use a controlled vocabulary, and the city and county are not necessarily separated hierarchically. According to Tim Sherratt, the value of digitised newspapers collections is that we can use the 'granularity of newspapers to expose the local, the particular, the personal and the ephemeral' (Sherratt 2015). The nineteenth-century newspaper landscape of the UK was particularly based around local and regional titles (Hobbs 2018). Geographic analysis using computational methods requires that the geographic data is correct: if we are to understand the local and regional differences of our collection items, they must be correctly and systematically resolved to a place.MethodThe ""smart annotation"" pipeline consists of two steps: an automatic resolution step and an interactive curation step.The first step follows a traditional toponym resolution process: we preprocess the relevant geographic metadata fields to obtain the main toponym and (potentially) a list of context toponyms that help to disambiguate the location of the main toponym. For example, given the two columns “Annan, Dumfries & Galloway” and “Scotland, UK”, we consider “Annan” as the main toponym and “Dumfries”, “Galloway”, “Scotland”, and “UK” as context toponyms. Using a Wikipedia-based gazetteer enhanced with information from Geonames, we select for each toponym (main or context) all potential candidates that might be their true referent, and attempt to resolve the true location of the main toponym taking the following features into account for each candidate:Confidence of the candidate referring to the toponym, depending on the source from which it has been obtained (Wikipedia page, Wikipedia redirection, Geonames altnames, etc),Relevance of main and context toponym candidates,Geographic distance between the different context toponym candidates with respect to the main toponym candidates,Whether the candidate location is in the country of the collection (UK in the case of the BL newspaper titles collection).The best candidates are selected through a scoring function that combines the different features to obtain the most likely resolution. We use this scoring function to calculate a confidence score for each main resolved toponym. This confidence score is then passed to the second step, in which results from the resolution process are uploaded to a Jupyter notebook where the annotator can validate each resolution and correct it if required (Figure 1, we use the ipyannotate Jupyter Widget for data annotation: https://github.com/ipyannotate/ipyannotate). The results to be annotated are sorted from low to high confidence, ensuring that those resolutions for which the system was less certain are validated and corrected first (Figure 2).ResultsWe have applied smart annotation (resolution, validation, and correction) to the ca. 25,000 newspaper titles from UK and Ireland. It took less than three hours of annotations to achieve an accuracy of 97% (allowing for an error margin of 10 miles between the resolved place and the gold standard).These results can be used to create accurate maps and conduct further geographic and demographic analysis. They help us to understand, for example, the changing focus of the press from national, to regional, to local. This disambiguation method has the potential to have a large impact on the field of newspaper and periodical studies, as high-quality metadata linked to a standard external resource allows us to understand both the collection and the wider newspaper landscape. Ultimately, the goal is to use this information to enhance and enrich existing BL metadata for the benefit of library users, so they can better understand the collection. We demonstrate the value of this technique with a visualisation tool we created using R, Shiny and Leaflet (see Figures 3 and 4).Resolved geographic metadata can help in understanding the geographic scope of the news collection. It enables the discovery of geographic bias in the digitised portion of a collection and enables collection data to be joined to census data to do demographic analysis. Because newspapers are richly geographical, correctly resolved geographic metadata can aid in the disambiguation of digitised newspaper text. The results presented here are based on the performance of a toponym resolution system (and of a gazetteer) that works well with the kinds of toponyms one can encounter in BL newspaper titles metadata: in English, and mostly focused on Great Britain and Ireland. In the future, we intend to apply this method to other metadata collections.* Code will be available on the Living with Machines GitHub organization: https://github.com/Living-with-Machines","yann.ryan@gmail.com, mcollardanuy@turing.ac.uk, daniel.van-strien@bl.uk, khossienizad@turing.ac.uk, kbeelen@turing.ac.uk, jhetherington@turing.ac.uk, kmcdonough@turing.ac.uk, bmcgillivray@turing.ac.uk, mia.ridge@bl.uk, olivia.vane@bl.uk, dwilson@turing.ac.uk",Long Presentation

As a consequence, no evidence is made between the price of an artwork and the critical comments on the latter, even if it seems obvious that such a link exists. This lightning talk aims at filling this gap by introducing Natural Language Processing, and more specifically, sentiment analysis, into econometrics (Généreux et al., 2008).The study of opinions is all the more relevant as it relates to an emerging market: the paper will thus focus on the Parisian auction sales of so-called “modern” paintings in the 19th century – as opposed to the Old Masters market. A comprehensive transcription of all the related catalogues (for more details, see Saint-Raymond, 2018) allowed to apply sentiment analysis to all the descriptions of the works sold at auction. The minutes of the sales, curated at the Archives de Paris, then provided the hammer prices, which were added to this dataset. Finally, hedonic regressions were run, including sentiment analysis (Liu, 2018) as an explanatory variable, in addition to all the traditional ones. Sentiment analysis is based on a lexical analysis taking into account the specificities of our corpus.This talk will be an opportunity to discuss our results and the relevance of this methodological encounter: how can one measure opinions on artworks and, more broadly, tastes?","lea.saint.raymond@gmail.com, thierry.poibeau@ens.fr",Lightning

Our goals are (1) to develop a workflow and methodology allowing us to visualize and analyze the interactions between rabbis as represented in the Babylonian Talmud; (2) to see if we could learn something new about the relationship between rabbis as represented in the Talmud and/or the process of its redaction; and (3) to present a public-facing interface allowing scholars to interact directly with our visualization.Many of the research questions that drive this project go back more than a century. Pioneering work in Jewish studies (especially Albeck (1969); Margolioth (1987)) has attempted to detail the relationships between some of these rabbis. This work remains valuable, although it sometimes uses outdated methodological assumptions. Some of the relationships, for example, are reconstructed on the basis of stories about rabbis that most scholars today would understand as late, fictional creations. So too, scholars have long tried to understand the process by which the Babylonian Talmud was redacted (for summary of the scholarship on this, see Rubenstein 2013). Historians have also tried to understand the rabbis as a “network”, although without applying the quantitative tools now available (Hezser (1997); Lapin (2012)).In this part of the project, we focused our attention on citation chains. Rabbis frequently say things in the name of other rabbis (e.g., “Rabbi X said in the name of Rabbi Y who said in the name of Rabbi Z” – these chains usually consist of two or three names but can go up to nine!). By focusing on simply the names in these chains (and not the content of what they reported), our work intersects with that of Zhitomirsky-Geffet and Prebor (2018) and Josh Waxman (2019). At the same time, both our workflow and the kinds of questions that we were asking of the network as a whole make it distinct.The first step in our workflow was to identify each instance of a citation chain in the Hebrew/Aramaic text. In order to do this, we compiled a list of the names of all rabbis mentioned in ancient rabbinic literature (along with any aliases that they had) and assigned each a unique numeric identifier. The list was created through both automated and manual processes. Then, we created and ran a pattern matching program on a digital version of the “standard” printed edition (Vilna) of the Babylonian Talmud text to identify instances of rabbinic names and citation chains. Once identified, the program split the citations into “source” and “target” rabbis so we could identify who was citing whom. The results of the automated process were highly accurate as we verified through manual review of a statistically significant sample.The program identified 5,245 citation instances. When grouped into unique interactions (e.g., Rabbi X may cite Rabbi Y twenty times, but we counted that as one unique interaction), we were left with 630 rabbis (our nodes) and 1217 unique interactions (our edges). We loaded our node and edges files into Gephi (Gephi) and UCINET. A visualization can be seen in Figure 1, which (using a Force Atlas 2 layout) groups the more connected rabbis toward the center.Figure 1: Graph of All Rabbis in Babylonian Talmud Who Appear in Citation ChainsWe have two major research findings. First, and less surprisingly, when separated into Modularity Classes through an unsupervised algorithm, the rabbis relatively cleanly separated into groups that clustered around rabbinic figures who themselves had many connections, which looks like a “school” structure (see Figure 2). Previous research has led us to expect this. Second, and more surprisingly, the rabbis at the centers of each of those circles were themselves densely and directly connected to each other. These ten or fifteen rabbis, over four centuries and two geographical locales, served as the backbone for the rabbinic network. It is still unclear to us whether these connections represent real social interactions or can better be explained as the result of later editing and redactional decisions and conventions.Figure 2: Rabbis in Citation Chains in Babylonian Talmud in Modularity ClassesThere are problems inherent in this data. The rabbis are themselves sometimes unsure about an attribution (and explicitly argue about it). Since rabbis sometimes shared names or nicknames, it is sometimes impossible to match with certainty a name with a distinct individual; in such cases we assigned the shared name to the more prominent rabbi. Moreover, we are just using one, easily available text. Manuscripts sometimes record these attributions differently. We feel that given the macro approach we took to this network, these problems become less significant. Nevertheless, they need to be better taken into account in future, more fine-grained analyses. By the time this is published, we should have our data and code freely available on Github. It may take us longer to develop a public-facing interface, perhaps along the lines of “The Six Degrees of Francis Bacon.” We will also extend our approach to other interactions in the Babylonian Talmud (e.g., when a rabbi asks a question of another rabbi); to other rabbinic texts from this period; and to other manuscript versions of these texts.","michael_satlow@brown.edu, mike.sperling@rocketmail.com",Lightning

The inscriptions are in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic. The purpose of the project is not only to allow for access and robust (and ultimately, federated) searching but also for scholarly analyses. As one of the longest running active digital epigraphy projects (with over 4,000 inscriptions entered to date), IIP provides several use cases of working with a complex and challenging multi-lingual corpus. This abstract will focus on our data modeling and approach to Linked Open Data.IIP was an early adopter of the Epidoc schema, a customization of TEI developed especially for those working with ancient texts preserved on durable materials, such as inscriptions and coins (Elliott, Bodard, Cayless). Many users of Epidoc are in contact with each other through epigraphy.info, and the schema is continually being modified in response to user requests. The general principle, however, is that each material object on which a text is inscribed or written is treated as a discrete XML file. IIP thus gives each inscription a unique, findable ID that also serves as its document name (e.g., ash0001.xml). Each file has an extensive teiHeader, in which we encode the metadata, where possible using controlled vocabularies as attributes of elements, linked to authority files. This kind of robust encoding allows for the database-style, faceted indexing and searching powered by SOLR that we provide through our interface. We also include images (although we have much more work to do collecting them) and geographical information. We have a geographical interface that allows for mapping (see Figure 1).Figure 1: Screenshot of Search Page of ""Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine""Our data has always been open. All of our XML files can be seen and downloaded individually directly from our site, or downloaded in bulk from our open Github site (https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/iip-texts) or through our API (for which we give detailed instructions on the site itself). We also encode our permission license (CC BY-NC 4.0) into our files.Since participating in the conference, “The Big Ancient Mediterranean” (BAM) we have sought to create links in our data in three ways. The primary geographical data within each inscription is linked to its corresponding Pleiades Gazetteer id (Pleiades). The primary chronological data within each inscription is linked to its corresponding PeriodO id (PeriodO).   And each of the types of object upon which the inscription is written is linked to the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (Getty). For example:                        <origin>                     <date period=""http://n2t.net/ark:/99152/p0m63njbxb9""                           notBefore=""0001""                           notAfter=""0100"">First century CE</date>                     <placeName>                                <region>Judaea</region>                                <settlement ref = ""http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/687928""> Jerusalem</settlement>                                <geogName type=""site"">Akeldama Caves</geogName>                                <geogFeat type=""locus"">Cave 2 Chamber B</geogFeat>                            </placeName>                                                      <p/>                        </origin>The use of these ids allows our data to be scraped live by different projects, such as Pleiades and the Pelagios Network (Pelagios Network). The community is just now beginning to develop an ecosystem that allows for the fruitful exchange of data between sites using Linked Open Data and we hope that through this expansion the usefulness of our data will expand.We added these links to existing data, which was a costly process. We first developed an XSLT script to extract the place, time, and object values into a spreadsheet. We then manually found and added the links, in the process having to submit new geographical and chronological values for inclusion in the other authorities (and then, in return, adding the new id numbers). We then used another XSLT script to insert the new links into the XML files. Along the way there was a great deal of checking and testing. For new data files, the additions are added at the time of creation.One of our active projects involves the lexicographical tagging of the texts in a way that could similarly be linked and shared. This entails performing word segmentation on the existing XML files, and then assigning part of speech tags using natural language parsing. This will enable new interface features and better forms of analysis. The Global Philology Project is an exploratory project that began to lay the infrastructure for compiling and analyzing lexicographical data in many different languages across multiple sites (Global Philology). We want to further explore how our tagging of individual words could make our data – on the level of the individual words of our texts – accessible and more useful to researchers in different fields.For a broader description of IIP and our goals, see Satlow (forthcoming) and Lembi (forthcoming). We describe our approach to bibliographical management at Lembi, Mylonas and Satlow (2016) and our approach to the FAIR principles (FAIR) in Mylonas, Lembi, Creamer, and Satlow.","michael_satlow@brown.edu, elli_mylonas@brown.edu",Short Presentation

By employing the TOSCA standard (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) to fully automate the deployment of DH applications and to keep them available in the long term, we try to tackle the problem of software obsolescence in the field of DH. To interactively demonstrate our approach to the international DH community, we would like to give a workshop on the topic ""Modelling and Maintaining Research Applications in TOSCA"" in the run-up to the DH 2020 conference. Thereinwe will show how to model (DH) software systems with TOSCA and share experiences and best practices on how to work with the OpenTOSCA ecosystem, an open-source implementation of the TOSCA standard.The ProblemThe establishment of the DH as an independent scientific research area as well as the increasing usage of digital methods in the research process require adjustments to common result assurance practices. For example, the long-term archiving (LTA) of primary research data uses well-established practices such as employing standardized data formats and forwarding data to permanent repositories. However, the fact that digital artifacts generated in DH-oriented research do not only consist of primary data but also contain research software is mostly disregarded (Sahle and Kronenwett, 2013). Moreover, the variety of DH research outcomes includes so-called ""living systems"" in which the software to present, access or analyze the data represents an essential part of the actual research output (Bingert et al., 2016). In contrast to classical research results such as monographs or encyclopedias, living systems cannot be served long-term without maintenance as their instantiation, supervision, and permanent provisioning represent major technical, organizational, and financial challenges. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of the research software generated in the DH requires a highly flexible preservation strategy, i.e., a suitable technology that ensures standardization, reusability, and archiving of as many digital artifacts as possible (Barzen et al., 2018). In addition to the aforementioned challenges, i.e., heterogeneity, underfunding, and obsolescence of digital artifacts, scientific practice requires long-term interoperability and traceability of all research outcomes. With regard to digital systems, these requirements are (1) constant accessibility, (2) the possibility of error-free operation, and (3) the ability to reconstruct any stage of development of a research application at any time without major structural difficulties.Our ApproachThe TOSCA standard (OASIS, 2013 and 2019) allows software systems to be modelled, provisioned, and deployed in a standardized and provider-independent manner. Thus, it is suitable for long-term archiving and operation of research applications produced within the field of DH (Neuefeind et al., 2018 and 2019). Following the TOSCA standard, applications are modelled in “Topology Templates” by describing their components and their relations amongst each other: Components are represented as “Node Templates”, while relations are modeled as “Relationship Templates”. Moreover, the semantics of a Node Template or Relationship Template are dictated by reusable types, i.e., “Node Types” and “Relationship Types” respectively. For example, a Python web application can be modelled as a Node Template that is an instance of the ""Python Application"" Node Type. To express that the Python Application accesses a MySQL database, a second Node Template that is of type ""MySQL Database"" can be added to the Topology Template. Then, the connection between both components can be described by a Relationship Template that is an instance of the Relationship Type ""connectsTo"". Additionally, to specify that both components are running on an Ubuntu virtual machine (VM), a Node Template of type ""Ubuntu VM"" can be added, while Relationship Templates of type “hostedOn” between the Python Application Node Template and the VM Node Template, as well as between the MySQL Database and the VM describe their respective hosting relations.Hereby, TOSCA's type system enables the modelling of reusable component types, e.g., the ""Python Application"" Node Type, which can be reused in multiple Topology Templates describing different applications. Therefore, synergic effects emerge as existing Node Types can be reused in other Topology Templates, easing the modelling of new applications. In addition, the open-source TOSCA implementation OpenTOSCA (Breitenbücher et al., 2016) offers the possibility to graphically model applications using the TOSCA editor “Winery” (Kopp et al., 2013) which further simplifies the creation of new applications by providing drag-and-drop modeling capabilities.Workshop CurriculumDuring our four hour workshop, we will (1) give an overview to different solutions for long-term preservation of living systems and (2) describe the modeling language TOSCA. Based on these theoretical units, practical tasks will introduce (3) the modelling of an existing application using TOSCA and (4) how applications can be deployed using the OpenTOSCA ecosystem. Thus, by combining the theoretical foundations and the practical application of TOSCA, the participants will be able to model (research) software systems according to the standard and provision and deploy applications using the OpenTOSCA ecosystem.The practical tasks are structured as follows: (1) Identify the components of an application and (2) describe them and their relations among each other in an TOSCA-based application topology, i.e., in a Topology Template. By fragmenting an application into its components and mapping them to TOSCA Node Types, the Topology Template describing the application can then be modelled using the OpenTOSCA ecosystem. Afterwards (3), the modelled TOSCA application will be deployed by the OpenTOSCA runtime. Moreover, by sharing our experiences and best practices in using OpenTOSCA with the community, we will introduce concepts such as ""software stacks"" in a practical way.Target GroupThe workshop is primarily designed for data center employees, libraries and other institutions focusing on infrastructures for long-term archiving and operation of heterogeneous software systems. Previous experience in dealing with Linux and writing shell scripts as well as with software stacks and service orchestration are helpful but not necessary for a successful participation. To provide a productive context for communicating the described content and to enable individual consultation and support, we designed the workshop for about 20 participants but limit it to a maximum of 30 participants.Technical PrerequisitesFor a successful participation in the workshop, it is necessary that each participant brings his/her own laptop. Although a shared instance of the OpenTOSCA ecosystem will be provided, it is desirable that all participants set up an OpenTOSCA instance on their work equipment prior to the workshop in order to perform modelling and deployment tasks on their own devices. Therefore, registered participants will be provided with all necessary information about system requirements and how to setup OpenTOSCA prior to the workshop. Furthermore, relevant documentation, publications, and manuals will be provided both in advance and in the context of the workshop. In addition, a stable internet connection as well as a sufficient number of power outlets for all electronic devices are indispensable.

The Digital Humanities currently focus on the possibilities digital methods provide for researching literature (Distant/Scalable Reading). However, digital media has also played an important role in the development of new literary genres and poetics like hypertext novels, literary blogs, twitter bots, text generators and many more. (Hayles 1999; Slater 2018; Rettberg 2019)On the one hand, these texts seem to be perfectly suited for computational methods since they are genuinely electronic. On the other hand, electronic media implies many new requirements for cultural institutions when dealing with these materials, especially regarding the process of archiving and re-presentation (Seiça, 2015). The high frequency of technical development in digital media means that hardware and software can be outdated and thus hard to find only years after the production of an electronic literary work. This calls for new archival strategies and for new, non-linear models of electronic text. (Kramski/Buelow, 2011; Connor et al., 2019)The newly founded interdisciplinary Science Data Center for Literature (SDC4Lit) aims to systematically reflect the technical and aesthetic nature and the resulting requirements of digital literature. Research and development take into account that modeling, archiving and analyzing digital literature needs to be closely connected to research questions in the respective domains. The SDC4Lit project combines four partners: the German Literature Archive (DLA), the High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, the department of computational linguistics and the department of digital humanities, both University of Stuttgart.SDC4Lit focuses on archival solutions and research methods. The group will develop longterm repositories for digital literature and respective research data and a web platform providing access to the repositories and to computational research tools. Thus, the project will develop and implement a sustainable data life cycle for born digital literature within its institutional framework. The repositories represent the main storage for continuous harvesting of net literature and for other born-digital material. The research platform provides specific tools and methods for further analysis of the works in the repositories. Repositories and research platform will be connected through an Advanced Programming Interface (API). This approach provides the possibility to integrate more repositories and to provide low-level access to the SDC-repositories to other projects. In addition to the digital objects and their metadata the project will develop and implement a dedicated repository for all research data. This includes all research data produced by the project SDC4Lit itself as well as research data generated by users, e.g. annotations or additional metadata for single objects or object classes.The involvement of the communities participating in the production, distribution, research and mediation of electronic literature will be a decisive element for the project. Outreach measures include workshops and seminars, working with focus groups and the installation of an advisory board. The collection, provision, research and mediation of literature in electronic media is a task that concerns both research and archives. It is the goal of SDC4Lit to work on and fulfill these tasks in an inclusive and interdisciplinary way as described above.","claus-michael.schlesinger@ilw.uni-stuttgart.de, viehhauser@ilw.uni-stuttgart.de, mona.ulrich@dla-marbach.de, jan.hess@dla-marbach.de, roland.kamzelak@dla-marbach.de, heinz.werner.kramski@dla-marbach.de, kerstin.jung@ims.uni-stuttgart.de, jonas.kuhn@ims.uni-stuttgart.de, schembera@hlrs.de, boenisch@hlrs.de, kaminski@hlrs.de",Poster

That has led various scholars in the humanities and other research areas to examine the importance and role of memes (Shifman, 2014a; Highfield & Leaver, 2016; McCulloch, 2019). Bauckhage (2011) defines the term Meme as “contents or concepts that spread rapidly among Internet users”. While memes with solely visual content are rising in popularity, one of the most common and historically important meme types is the “image macro” which consists of a reusable image template with a top and/or bottom text (figure 1).Figure 1: Typical format of an image macroThere are various established image templates (see figure 2 for an example) and with the growth of social media, new ones are constantly emerging. We differentiate between the meme template, which is basically just the image of a meme and the meme derivatives, which are the multiple manifestations of a meme template differing regarding the text of the meme.Figure 2: Example of “Scumbag Steve”, a popular image macro memeAlthough memes are distributed and shared in large quantities, the majority of current research on memes is qualitative, e.g. analyzing patterns and stylistic rules of a small number of memes (Shifman, 2014b; Osterroth, 2015). Since image macros typically have a textual component, we want to use computational methods of Distant Reading (Moretti, 2013) to analyze memes in a large-scale approach. Our project aims to identify developments of the content and sentiment of memes in a diachronic way but is also based on image templates. In this paper we present first results on the corpus acquisition workflow we have developed as well as the application of general text analysis, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis on the overall corpus.2. Corpus CreationTo create a corpus for our analysis we use the platform knowyourmeme (https://knowyourmeme.com/). It is one of the most popular platforms for uploading memes and offers the possibility to search for specific meme categories like image macros. Furthermore, the different derivatives of a meme template are collected under a single entry and are enriched with metadata. For our first analysis, we focus on 16 of the historically most popular templates and we have implemented a scraper to access the links to the meme derivatives and metadata. To get the text of the memes we use Google Cloud OCR on the images gathered. Our final dataset consists of 7.840 meme derivatives, metadata and the text (see figure 3). This corpus is publicly available for the research community to download and use: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESecAyzfWvXTELflbWwZEXWE_tGKq8wmTTpOTSSrDJY/edit?usp=sharingPlease note that we only include memes with English language since this is the language knowyourmeme is focused on.Figure 3: Corpus description3. Corpus AnalysisFor all approaches, we have implemented various preprocessing steps commonly used in text mining (e.g. lemmatization). Figure 4 shows a word cloud of the most frequent words of the entire corpus:Figure 4: Word cloud of the most frequent words of the entire corpusThe word cloud illustrates the specifics of meme language like the dominance of slang. One can also identify some word patterns that are consistently used on some memes like e.g. “yo” and “dawg” being common words for the “Xzibit Yo Dawg”-meme template.For topic modeling, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, Blei et al., 2003) to calculate 16 LDA topics. LDA topics are described by typical word clusters within documents (here: meme derivatives), thus topic modeling produces lists of words that appear frequently together in documents. Our assumption is that every meme template is equivalent to a topic, thus we chose the number of our image macros as topic number (16).Figure 5 illustrates our results for the topic modeling analysis:Figure 5: 16 LDA topics of the corpus; with the five most contributing tokens per topicAs expected, most of the topics are expressions of a single meme template (e.g. topic 1 for the “Ermahgered” or topic 3 for the “XZibit Yo Dawg” meme template) which shows that some memes consist of homogenous and reoccurring word patterns. However, there are some overlaps like topic 15, expressing words common in the “Ancient Alien” and “Grumpy Cat” meme. We plan to investigate these memes in future work in more detail to examine the similarities they have in more detail.For the sentiment analysis, we use the sentiment lexicon “Bing” (Liu, 2012; Liu & Zhang, 2012) for polarity (positive, negative) and the NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2013) for emotions. Figure 6 shows which words contribute the most to a specific overall sentiment:Figure 6: Most important tokens contributing to the overall sentiment in the corpusThough we cannot report the results of the sentiment and emotion comparisons among the memes in detail, one outlier meme we want to highlight is the “Ancient Alien” meme. The “Ancient Alien” meme has the highest values for disgust and fear, which is a fitting result since those memes are often used in the context of conspiracy theories.Currently, our research is at an early stage and exploratory. In future work, we want to continue our analysis by increasing our corpus, filtering out noise during the acquisition and gather more metadata to perform diachronic and meme based analysis and comparisons considering sentiments and topics.","thomas.schmidt@ur.de, Philipp1.Hartl@stud.uni-regensburg.de, Dominik.Ramsauer@stud.uni-regensburg.de, Thomas1.Fischer@stud.uni-regensburg.de, Andreas.Hilzenthaler@stud.uni-regensburg.de, christian.wolff@ur.de",Poster

Distant Reading has led to various successful projects especially in literary studies and linguistics (cf. Jänicke et al., 2015) but also religious studies, e.g. to analyze famous religious texts (McDonald, 2014; Slingerland et al.; 2017; Verma, 2017). We want to build primarily upon the work of (Pfahler et al., 2018) who applied topic modeling on Muslim online forums to investigate what this community is predominantly talking about. They identified several main topic clusters about eating, family and politics which are talked about the most.We want to further explore the application and potential benefit of Distant Reading-methods for the use case of religious online forums. Our research goal is to examine the content, language, topics and sentiments in religious online forums of different religious subgroups to identify differences and similarities and learn more about the way of life and beliefs of these communities.While we explore multiple methods like named entity recognition, topic modeling and sentiment analysis, in the following contribution we report upon our results for the method of collocation analysis. Via collocations, we want to analyze differences in the way several religious key concepts are discussed in online forums of different religious subgroups.2. MethodsWe have chosen Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/) for data collection since it is rather easy to scrape and one of the largest platforms on the internet. Furthermore, various religious subgroups are represented enabling us to compare content more easily.We have acquired all submissions (threads) for the time span of July 1, 2018 to July 1, 2019 for the three subreddits /r/Christianity (https://www.reddit.com/) , /r/Islam (https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/) and /r/Occult (https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/) . We chose the first two since they represent the two largest monotheistic religions and included the third one to also examine a rather esoteric religious direction.We have acquired over 700,000 comments and around 50 million tokens (figure 1).Figure 1: Corpus statisticsWe have chosen five as maximum length for a collocation and measure the strength of collocations via Pointwise Mutual Information (PIM) which scores the collocations based on their actual co-occurrence in the corpus in proportion to their expected co-occurrence if they were independent (Church & Hanks, 1989). To visualize collocations, we place the key concept in the middle and the collocations around them. The higher the PMI-value, the closer the concept. We also put the exact PMI-score on the edges.3. ResultsIn the following we showcase the use case for the spiritual key terms “love”, “religion” and “life” and highlight some insights we gained.Figure 2: Collocations for “love” in /r/IslamFigure 3: Collocations for “love” in /r/ChristianityFigure 4: Collocations for “love” in /r/OccultIn the Christian subreddit, we find that love shows most connections with idioms/quotes from the bible (“unconditionally”, “enemies”, “agape”; figure 3). In contrast, we find strong associations with positive terms, words for god and the prophet as well as for “family” in the Muslim forum (figure 2) which is in line with Pfahler et al. (2018) showing a strong focus on family-related topics in Muslim forums. For /r/occult we find rather fitting associations with the notion of magic, thus showing the rather esoteric content of this forum (figure 4).Figure 5: Collocations for “religion” in /r/IslamFigure 6: Collocations for “religion” in /r/ChristianityFigure 7: Collocations for “religion” in /r/OccultMany terms in /r/Islam and the concept of religion point to discussions about religious directions e.g. “organized”, “abrahamic”, “culture”, “major” (figure 5). The connection with race might be connected to the racism Muslims face in western countries. Quite similarly, /r/Christianity also shows collocations describing the discussion about other religions (“organized”, “islam”, “false”) also pointing to rather heated discussions (“utter”, “nonsense”; figure 6). /r/Occult shows collocations specifying the religion and other world views (“Egypt”, “ancient”, “philosophy”, “science”; figure 7).Figure 8: Collocations for “life” in /r/IslamFigure 9: Collocations for “life” in /r/ChristianityFigure 10: Collocations for “life” in /r/OccultIn /r/Christianity, “life” is associated with words pointing to the afterlife (“everlasting”, “eternal”, “immortal”) while in /r/Islam, it is rather tied to terms describing a direction in life (“purpose”, “meaning”; figure 8 and 9). However, both subreddits show connections with rather positive words except for death concepts. Those collocations are indeed stronger for /r/Islam (“rest”, “death”, “short”). The collocations are quite varied for /r/occult (figure 10).Overall, we were able to gather some first insights like the strong difference of /r/occult, connections to family and politics for some key concepts in the Muslim forum or the focus on discussions about religious directions for the concept of religion in all forums.We plan to investigate other methods of computational text analysis but also want to apply more in-depth qualitative analysis of parts of our corpus via content analysis to confirm and evaluate some of our assumptions we derived via the collocation visualizations.","thomas.schmidt@ur.de, Florian.Kaindl@stud.uni-regensburg.de, christian.wolff@ur.de",Poster

It spurs alternative formulations ('Scalable Reading', Mueller 2012) and is present in mainstream media (""What is Distant Reading?"", Schulz 2011). It is a popular and integrating term, but can take very specific meaning as well.1However, the semantic content carried over in each case of adoption or adaption is often unclear. Recent debates, like the special issue of PMLA (On Franco Moretti’s Distant Reading 2017) or the paper by Nan Z. Da (Da 2019) and the reactions to it, have challenged some of the assumptions of 'distant reading'. Also, the polysemy of the term may have contributed to misunderstandings in these debates.Therefore, our aim is to recover the historicity of the term 'distant reading', first introduced by Franco Moretti (2000) in his discussion of world literature as a system, by delineating how its meaning has changed over time and reconstructing some of the key theoretical assumptions it carries both as a term, a concept and a practice.Historical rootsThe pre-history to the concept now covered by the term 'distant reading' reaches back to the 15th century, when a rhetorical topos of ""too many books"" appeared (see Blair 2011). The solution was in excerpts and encyclopedias, based on the principles of compilation and summarization. The goal was to provide access to the essence of all relevant books instead of having to see them all at the same time. Of course, quantitative approaches to literary texts have appeared before the advent of computing (e.g. Mendenhall 1887) and computational approaches have diversified before the term 'distant reading' appeared (e.g. Ellegård 1962, Mosteller and Wallace 1963, Burrows 1987; see Hockey 2000).Conceptual DevelopmentWhen Franco Moretti first coined the term 'distant reading' in 2000, he used it with a meaning reminiscent of the compilatory origins of the concept, similar to ""second-hand reading"": using research literature, metadata or other short-cuts like titles and subtitles instead of reading the full text. From this starting point, and in parallel with more computational and more quantitative practices, Distant Reading has evolved to designate any computational, but especially quantitative, method of literary text analysis - so much so that the term now 'self-evidently implies computation' (Goldstone 2017, 637; see also Underwood 2017 and Bode 2017).Theoretical AssumptionsA fundamental assumption of the earlier concept of 'distant reading' was that because metadata or secondary literature are created by humans who have read the full texts, they can stand in for the full text. Also, that the bird's eye's view provides insight into the longue durée and into literature as a system (Oberhelman 2015). A fundamental assumption of current Distant Reading research is that useful (even if imperfect) formal and quantifiable textual features can be used as indicators or proxies for relevant literary phenomena, hence the centrality of modeling (see McCarty 2005; Flanders and Jannidis 2019) in Distant Reading research practice. Finally, the idea that despite the broadening meaning of the term “literature” (decanonization), literary texts have a specific way of functioning that requires the adaptation of methods to this domain.ConclusionWe hope that by more usefully contextualizing the development of the strategic term 'distant reading', we can help avoid misunderstandings in current debates about computational approaches in humanistic inquiry.","schoech@uni-trier.de, maciejeder@gmail.com, rarias@uma.es, pieter.francois@stb.ox.ac.uk, antonija.primorac@uniri.hr",Short Presentation

One of the key conferences in the field, NeurIPS, has reacted by appointing 'reproducibility chairs' in their organizing committee 1. In the Digital Humanities, and particularly in Computational Literary Studies (CLS), there is an increasing awareness of the crucial role played by replication in evidence-based research. Relevant disciplinary developments include the increased importance of evaluation in text analysis and the increased interest in making research transparent through publicly accessible data and code (open source, open data). Specific impulses include Geoffrey Rockwell and Stéfan Sinclair's re-enactments of pre-digital studies (Sinclair and Rockwell 2015) or the recent replication study by Nan Z. Da (Da 2019). The paper has been met by an avalanche of responses that pushed back several of its key claims, including its rather sweeping condemnation of the replicated papers. However, an important point got buried in the process: that replication is indeed a valuable goal and practice. 2As stated in the Open Science Collaboration paper: ""Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not"" (Open Science Collaboration 2015, 943).As a consequence, the panel aims to raise a number of issues regarding the place, types, challenges and affordances, both on a practical and on a policy or community level, of replication in CLS. Several impulse papers will address key aspects of the issue: recent experience with attempts at replication of specific papers; policies dealing with replication in fields with more experience in the issue; conceptual and terminological clarification with regard to replication studies; and proposals for a way forward with replication as a community task or a policy issue.Contribution 1: ""A typology of replication studies"", by Christof SchöchThis contribution aims to provide orientation about the range of existing replication studies, based on a simple typology. The typology describes the relationship between an earlier study and its replication in terms of four key variables: the research question, the method of analysis (including the implementation of that method) and the dataset used. 3 For each of these variables, a replication study can attempt to operate either in the same way as the previous study, or in a different way. Note that the typology is not meant to establish these distinctions in a purely binary fashion: rather, as data or methods are never entirely identical or completely different from the earlier study, the extreme points in the typology are meant to open up a gradient of pratices. In addition (and this aspect might be unique to the Digital Humanities), replication studies can be described as involving crossing the boundary between non-digital and digital research or between qualitative and quantitative research.[Figure 1: Typology of repeating research]At the most fundamental level, such a typology structures the field and provides a clearly-defined terminology and systematic relations between the various types. For example, replication vs. reproduction or re-analysis vs. follow-up research. Such a shared understanding is useful because each type of replication study comes with its own objectives, requirements and challenges as well as their own place and function in the research process. A replication study strictly repeating key aspects of an earlier study will be most useful in reviewing and quality assessment, while follow-up research more loosely modeled after an earlier study may instead have important methodological implications or lead to knew domain knowledge. This is true despite the fact that in reality, there is more to consider than a few binary categories when describing a given replication study.But understanding replication through such a typology can have an impact on the field of DH in a number of additional ways. It can provide guidance when publishing research and help clarify what needs to be provided (in terms of data, code and contextualization in prose) in order for a study to be amenable to a specific type of replication. It can help assess the merits and limitations of a given replication study to assess whether, given the stated objectives of the authors, they have employed a suitable type of replication strategy. And it can support designing a replication study and clarify what data, code and contextual information needs to be obtained or reconstructed in order to perform a specific type of replication. 4Beyond this, such a typology can contribute to better define the relationship between replication in the strict sense and related efforts like benchmarking and evaluation studies. Finally, because such a typology makes it easier to identify similar studies across disciplinary boundaries, it may help us as a field learn more quickly from other fields with a longer tradition in (specific types of) replication studies. In this way, such a typology of replication studies can contribute to establishing replication as a well-understood part of Computational Literary Studies.Contribution 2: ""Replication to the Rescue: Funding Strategies"", by Karina Van Dalen-OskamThe Dutch Research Council (NWO) is the first funding agency to take the initiative for a pilot programme for Replication Studies. Their aim is ""to encourage researchers to carry out replication research. NWO wants to gain experience that can lead to insights into how replication research can be effectively included in research programmes. That experience should also lead to insights into and a reflection on the requirements that NWO sets for research in terms of methodology and transparency."" 5The first two rounds of funding were in 2017 and 2018, and were aimed at the Social Sciences and Medical Sciences. In the third round in 2019, the Humanities were included.This was done after a heated discussion in Nature between Rik Peels and Lex Bouter (chair of the Replication Studies Programme Committee) on the one hand, and Bart Pender, Sarah de Rijcke and J. Britt Holbrook on the other. Peels and Bouter (2018) started of with a note titled ""Humanities need a replication drive too"". De Rijke and Penders (2018), both scholars from Science and Technology Studies, countered with the call to ""Resist calls for replicability in the humanities"". They argue that quality criteria are crucially different in the humanities and the sciences. 6NWO went ahead with including the humanities in the call for replication studies, stating they are aware that not all humanities research is suitable for replication. NWO ""expresses no preference or opinion about the value of various methods of research. Where possible it wants to encourage and facilitate the replication of humanities research: this should certainly be possible in the empirical humanities."" 7In March 2020, seven proposals were awarded funding, but none of these can be called typical Humanities projects. 8How many submissions were received from humanities applicants - did scholars indeed resist, as Pender and De Rijcke advised? And in a wider context: How do Dutch Humanities scholars evaluate the new possibility? And does this agree with the reception in the growing and very active Dutch Digital Humanities community?In my short impulse paper, I will reflect on what we can learn from the explicit invitation to the humanties to apply for funding for replication studies. What does this tell us about the status of humanities research in the Netherlands, and more specifically about the role of the Digital Humanities? I will pay special attention to the opportunities these developments may have for Computational Literary Studies. Should we consider the situation as ""Funding Strategies to the Rescue: Replication"", so a turning around of the title of my talk?Contribution 3: ""Replication of quantitative and qualitative research - a case study"", by Fotis JannidisLiterary studies always had an empirical side - 'empirical' in the broader sense, that claims and counterclaims are substantiated by referring to specific parts of texts. These text segments are regarded as indicators which in their sum make a more general point plausible, for example the use of specific terms to validate a hypothesis about a text. Therefore, the concept of replication warrants a wider understanding in Computational Literary Studies. The prototypical center is the quantitative replication of quantitative research, but it also includes quantitative replication of qualitative philological research: Using the same indicators to validate the same hypothesis but moving the research into an empirical framework. Seen in the context of the discussion of mixed methods, this is a specific case of ‘triangulation’. Triangulation refers to “the application of different data analysis methods, different data sets, or different researchers’ perspective to examine the same research question or theme” (Bergin 2018, 29). But here, data sets and data analysis methods overlap strongly, while the research framework is changed from hermeneutic to quantitative.Our case study is an attempt to replicate research on the complexity of language in German dime novels, published by Peter Nusser (Nusser 1981), and it demands both kinds of replication. Nusser describes the language of dime novels on three levels: vocabulary, syntax, and phrases. The work on vocabulary and syntax is quantitative, while the analysis of phrases is qualitative. The replication of the quantitative parts is made more difficult by the fact that the results which Nusser reports have actually been produced by another author in the context of an unprinted exam thesis which seems to be lost for the moment. So a lot of information is missing, and we can only make educated guesses: the exact corpus design (for high literature only the authors are given and for dime novels only the series), the strategies of tokenization and sentence splitting, the exact formula for calculating specific values, etc. The qualitative research is enumerating many phrases which are seen as examples of clichés and there is no explicit comparison with high literature. So a quantification must try to operationalize the concept of cliché and then compare retrieval results between dime novels and high literature.As is well known in Computational Literary Studies, operationalization as an instance of formal modeling usually covers some aspects that are part of the intuitive notion, while others are excluded for the time being and it is one goal to reduce the loss (Moretti (2013); for a counterposition see Underwood (2019, 181)). In a replication, the loss may be responsible for the difference in outcome. In view of all these difficulties it could seem an unnecessary endeavor to replicate the research, but Nusser’s study had a huge influence on the assessment and evaluation of popular literature in German studies for almost four decades.Contribution 4: ""Reliable methods for text analysis"", by Maria Antoniak and David MimnoIf we are to make reproducible computational claims about literary texts, we need methods that lend themselves to robustness and reliability. Here we focus on the case study of word embeddings, which analyze collections of documents and produce numeric representations of words. Although these methods are powerful, they are also at high risk for problems with reproducibility: they are complicated enough to be essentially ""black boxes"", yet they are also known to be highly sensitive to text curation choices, parameter settings, and even random initializations (Antoniak and Mimno 2018). How can we assure researchers and their audiences that seemingly small changes would not alter or even reverse their findings?Embedding vectors are useful for their ability to operationalize thick cultural concepts. For example, the resulting vectors have been used to measure shifts in word meaning over time and geographic areas (e.g. Hamilton, Lescovec, and Jurafsky (2016); Kulkarni, Perozzi, and Skiena (2016)). Several studies have shown that embeddings can encode gender biases by probing embedding spaces using carefully chosen seed words (Gordon and Van Durme (2013); (Bolukbasi et al. 2016a); Caliskan Islam, Bryson, and Narayanan (2016)). Subsequent work in natural language processing has focused on removing biases from an embedding model (Bolukbasi et al. (2016b); Sutton, Lansdall, and Cristianini (2018)). In this context, the concern is the downstream impact of bias on systems that use embeddings, but similar work can also be motivated from an upstream perspective, as a means of studying bias in collections.Researchers from the humanities and social sciences use embeddings to provide quantitative answers to otherwise elusive political and social questions about the training corpus and its authors (e.g. Kozlowski, Taddy, and Evans (2019)). These bias detection techniques were originally intended to measure the bias encoded in a trained embedding; they were not originally tested to measure the bias of a corpus and make comparisons between corpora.We probe the stability of these measurements by testing two popular bias detection methods ( Bolukbasi et al. (2016a); Caliskan Islam, Bryson, and Narayanan (2016)) on sets of automatically constructed seed sets. These sets were constructed by randomly selecting a target term and then including its N nearest neighbors in the set; this process more closely approximates a real seed set, constructed by a scholar interested in a particular concept, than a random set of seeds. We find that bias detection techniques via word embeddings are susceptible to variability in the seed terms, in both their order (alternative pairings of seeds from two sets can significantly change the ability of the method to capture a single bias subspace) and semantic similarity (the more similar seeds set are to each other, the more difficult it is to measure their biases). If done carefully, bias detection using embeddings is feasible even for small, subdivided collections and can provide a promising tool for differential content analysis, but we encourage error analysis of the seed terms.We further highlight a central inconsistency in these bias detection methods. While these methods seek to measure biases in datasets, the researcher-selected seeds themselves can contain a variety of biases. For example, the seeds used for racial categories often include lists of names that are ""African American"" or ""European."" Such lists can be both reductive and essentializing. In addition, some seed sets contain confounding terms, e.g., contain a gendered term in a seed set for ""domestic work"" that is then used to measure gender bias. If the seed set for ""domestic work"" appears closer to the gender that it contains, it will be impossible to say whether that bias exists because of the training corpus or because of the inclusion of the gendered seed.This case study highlights the reversal in perspectives when techniques from natural language processing and machine learning are re-purposed for studies of specialized datasets. Some working assumptions from the machine learning community (e.g. large size of training set) are broken in the humanities context, where datasets are non-expandable and are the primary focus of the study, rather than a generalized training set for downstream applications. The stability and robustness of these repurposings should not be assumed but rather should be reanalyzed for the particular new contexts.","schoech@uni-trier.de, karina.van.dalen@huygens.knaw.nl, maa343@cornell.edu, fotis.jannidis@uni-wuerzburg.de, mimno@cornell.edu",Panel

For textual documents, inline (typically TEI-XML) and stand-off (e.g. character index table based) markup are two widely used approaches. For adding textual annotations, various software affording different types and levels of abstraction are used, including XML editors such as Oxygen as well as online systems such as Catma. Many annotation systems enable annotation of other media than verbal text in various ways, often with a focus on images and figures. Systems are also available for audio annotation of text and music, and for video annotations. Annotation systems for 3D models are less common and many users in the humanities and cultural heritage resort to online platforms such as Sketchfab. Commercial platforms might be a good choice in many cases, but copyright issues and legal obligations make them unwanted or unusable in other. Furthermore, with these 3D presentation platforms, the focus is not on (collaborative) annotation as a method. Since 2017, the Departments for Digital Humanities and Media Culture and Theatre at the University of Cologne, in cooperation with the university’s Theatre Collection, has developed Kompakkt a free online tool for multi-modal 3D annotations which is specifically designed for collaborative work and storytelling. Kompakkt is fully open source and opt for new ways to provide public access for cultural heritage objects, archival material, etc.Figure 1: A schematic representation of annotations in Kompakkt [9]With Kompakkt, the 3D representation of an object serves as the hub of an open-ended collection of heterogeneous information established through the use of multimodal annotations, cf. Figure 1. Through personalised and group level collections of digital objects, Kompakkt enables a novel solution for gathering, generating and inter-connecting information about digital objects and related non-digital things. Registered users may decide if their content is restricted, private or public to control the visibility and access to their objects.Through opening up for collaborative annotation of objects, multi-vocal voices can be heard, presenting traditional scholarly and cultural heritage management perspectives as well as knowledge based on citizen humanities. Diverse groups around the world can annotate, discuss, and tell multiple stories about collections of objects, making sets of open data available to be discussed, further developed, and experienced. The annotation functionality for images and 3D models enables linking between repository-internal objects and external information through weblinks. Therefore every single point on the surface of the mesh can be selected. An annotation is not only linked to a specific location in space, it also includes and covers a user defined related perspective, the corresponding point of view. Multiple Annotations in Kompakkt are chained in flexible series what allows users to walk through the different related, thereby enabling a camera track by stepping from one annotation to the next and its corresponding perspective. Consequently, presentations and storytelling can be implemented through a series of annotations traversing through different objects.The challenge posed by the future of Kompakkt is primarily to increase the community and scale up the number of available objects. Therefore it is not only important to ensure the quality of the data through curation but also to develop the import and export functionality further and in general to enhance the usability with the help of user feedback. Additionally with the feedback from the community from the prototyping phase helps to improve and expand the annotation functionality and implement new suggested features.","zoe.schubert@uni-koeln.de, enes.tuerkoglu@uni-koeln.de, oeide@uni-koeln.de, jan.wieners@uni-koeln.de, kai.niebes@uni-koeln.de",Poster

Whereas DARIAH-DE had a clear focus on textual data and e.g. its representation in form of digital editions, the focus of CLARIN-D was more the provision of data and tools for linguistic analysis. Funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research, both infrastructures will be merged within CLARIAH-DE (2019-2021), building on earlier cooperation and coordination processes, and aiming at interoperability in the future (also in accordance with the FAIR data principles). In CLARIAH-DE Work Package (WP) 1 “Research Data, Standards and Procedures” one potential solution to enable interoperability is the use of prevalent TEI customizations like the German Text Archive’s base format (DTABf) as an exchange or target format. While the DTABf is already established as a pivot format for text collections (especially for the annotation of full texts of historical prints, and for newspapers and simply structured manuscripts), it will be now evaluated to what extent the DTABf can be applied to the diverse field of digital scholarly editing. Although such an exchange or pivot format may not be able to represent all previously coded information in the original depth, the underlying idea is that it still can be understood as a core data set, and therefore function as a common denominator.The evaluation is based on case studies of selected digital editions, and led by the following questions:Which phenomena in the digital editions are currently not covered by the DTABf tag set? Which phenomena are encoded differently in the DTABf than in the digital editions? Is a mapping more or less unproblematic or are there fundamental (semantic) differences? Which information is required by the DTABf, but has not been encoded in the digital editions? The encoded phenomena can be classified as loss-free transferable, partially transferable and missing or lost. Depending on the effort and the outcome, a conversion might result in either a DTABf-valid text, in which all necessary information has been encoded accordingly, but in which the encoding is also limited to the elements and attribute-value pairs permitted in the DTABf, or in a DTABf-compliant text, which contains a core encoding according to the DTABf, but which may also have annotations going beyond the DTABf. To ensure the diversity and thus the representability of the underlying data, the editions chosen to serve as case studies for the evaluation should differ significantly from each other. Therefore, seven criteria were developed based on a review of relevant literature and existing editions. These criteria, for example the editorial model applied, the TEI modules used or the source material, resulted in an edition matrix (EdMa), which – beyond the purposes of the CLARIAH-DE-project – should enable a rough categorisation of digital editions in general.The paper aims at outlining and discussing the problems in harmonizing standards between the two former separated infrastructures and the actions that have been taken so far, to bypass these obstacles. By using CLARIAH-DE as a concrete example, the presentation will therefore contribute to the general discussion on standardization within the context of national research infrastructures.",schulz@hab.de,Short Presentation

Despite these needs, software tools that is available for chronological information from humanities are limited. HuTime is a visualization and analysis tool specialized in the chronological information of humanities. Figure 1: Example of visualizing chronological data1. HuTime has functions to insert images into a timeline and to decorate fonts.Purpose of HuTimeThe time information system, HuTime, aims at providing an environment that includes functions and operations equivalent to geographic information systems for analyzing chronological information (Sekino 2009). HuTime is provided as a JavaScript library2, and it can be accessed using a web browser installed on a personal computer or a smart device such as a tablet. Various visualization tools have been developed (e.g., Aigner et al. 2005 and Havre et al. 2000). Additionally, there are other tools used to display a timeline on a web browser (e.g., SIMILE Timeline3, Timeglider4 and TimelineJS5). However, most of these tools display a timeline using data created according to a strict regulation; therefore, processing diversified and complicated data of humanities is difficult. In contrast, HuTime targets humanities and has various functions for data from humanities (""Hu"" in the name of ""HuTime"" originates from the humanities).Main Features for Humanities(processing diversified time representations)As calendar systems differ between countries and historical periods, researchers need to standardize dates in data of humanities to compare them chronologically. Additionally, time periods in humanities are often provided as approximate representations (e.g., ""early 17th century"") or vague historical periods whose beginning and end points are uncertain (e.g., ""Renaissance""). HuTime can process such difficult time representations by applying HuTime Calendar Linked Open Data (Sekino 2017) and a theory for uncertain time (Sekino 2019, 2020), and display these data on a common temporal axis based on the time representations.(visualizing various contents of the Humanities)HuTime can chronologically display numerical and image data as well as text data. This function enables researchers to chronologically examine text data, associating it with statistical data such as population dynamics or with photos indicating temporal changes in historical materials such as a cultural asset.HuTime can directly process data from different web sites on the internet. Recently, various kinds of open data from humanities are increasing on the internet; therefore, HuTime can utilize them effectively.ApplicationHuTime which provides chronological functions is available as a library for various web applications. For example, when HuTime is embedded in a database application as a user interface, the application displays a retrieval result on the embedded HuTime (e.g., Ichino et al. 2018).HuTime is an open source software whose source code is available on GitHub6, and is expected to be a platform for chronological information equivalent to Google Maps, which provides a platform for geographic information.

However, existing topic modeling tools are often inaccessible to less technically-adept users. The most popular tools require either using the command line or writing code1. While a GUI2 exists, researchers have expressed frustrations with its limited feature set. HANDLE (Heuristic Analytical Digital Language Environment) is a better GUI for MALLET3 that offers easier text importing, topic model building, visualization, and data exporting, and was developed at UCLA’s Scholarly Innovation Lab. Increasing the accessibility of text mining facilitates research at all levels, from undergraduate to faculty, by making it easier to perform research and communicate it to a wider audience.One-step ImportingHANDLE removes one of the stumbling blocks for first-time users by simplifying importing text. It features a drag-and-drop interface for importing files so that students do not need to learn the command line tools for MALLET. HANDLE can import plain text and Word documents. Second, a window shows the text as MALLET will understand it: punctuation is removed, and stopwords are replaced with struck-through text. Third, the defaults preserve accent marks and non-Latin characters; more advanced users can adjust these settings. Fourth, stopword settings can be adjusted: a user can drag-and-drop stopword list files into the program, and new stopwords can be added through a contextual menu.Convenient ExperimentationMost users have to try a few different topic models with different settings before they find one that works, but MALLET only accepts input from the command line, leaving users with the tedious task of retyping commands to change one setting. HANDLE addresses this issue by providing a graphical interface for creating topic models, reducing the number of opportunities for errors. HANDLE also shows a list of all the topic models a user has created and remembers the settings used for each, making comparisons and documentation easier. HANDLE also allows a user to save a project (a collection of documents and topic models) and come back to it later.Easy VisualizationHANDLE has integrated visualizations. For each topic model, an LDAViz4-inspired interface can be used to explore topic similarity and the top words in each topic. Another interface displays the topics that make up a specific document, and their proportions. These images can be exported for articles or papers.Export Data into Familiar ToolsBecause no tool can anticipate all use cases, HANDLE can export its data in formats that are easy to manipulate. Summaries of all topics within all documents, called “document topic reports” in MALLET, can be exported as spreadsheets. Topic model files can be exported for use with command-line MALLET, or for other computers running HANDLE. HANDLE allows users to focus on the data rather than getting the tool to run, and to work with their data in environments more familiar to them.HANDLE will be released as an open-source project on GitHub by summer 2020.",shepard.david@gmail.com,Poster

Our prior work showed that it is possible to identify rumors (stories about events that have no basis in fact) on twitter by observing the relationship between the number of tweets about an event and the number of topics within those tweets (Shepard et al., 2019). In that paper, we presented case studies, but could not measure the difference between rumors and facts. This paper builds on that work by presenting a formula for making that distinction: given a data set of tweet texts with time stamps, our method automatically discovers rumors in those tweets. This paper presents our method, which is completely unsupervised in contrast to most recent work on rumor detection. As a case study, it demonstrates the method’s effectiveness on a sample dataset of tweets from the 3/11 earthquake in Japan.BackgroundAt least seven new methods have been proposed for rumor detection on twitter in the past two years, including (Wang et al., 2017; Singh et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Yoshida and Aritsugi, 2019; Ma et al., 2018; Poddar et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2019). One major constraint of these approaches, however, is that all of them require supervised learning. Our major intervention is that our approach is unsupervised and language-independent. Our algorithm makes only the assumption that the text has been tokenized into words.MethodOur approach results from the observation that little new information emerges about rumors. For example, if a chemical spill is announced on twitter, people often retweet the announcement. People are also likely to be affected in some way, such as seeing emergency vehicles or evacuating the area. New information will be created as the event progresses. If the spill is just a rumor, however, people will have no new information to add, and so will simply retweet the original rumor. We call the amount of information surrounding an event its “topic diversity.” Calculating an event’s topic diversity allows us to classify an event as a rumor or a fact. A true event will have both high tweet counts and high topic diversity, while a rumor will have high tweet counts but low topic diversity.The first step in calculating topic diversity is separating our data into what we call word-window tweet lists, or WWTLs. These are lists of tweets that mention a word, split into 30-minute windows. We generate WWTLs for every word in our dataset of tweets, after removing stopwords. Next, we compute each WWTL’s topic diversity by performing topic modeling on each WWTL and counting the number of topics produced. We use a novel method of topic modeling that determines the number of topics automatically based on maximal clique enumeration (MCE). To prepare a TTWL for MCE, we first generate a graph of all tweets. Each node represents one tweet, and edges are generated by computing the Jaccard similarity of each pair of tweets based on shared vocabulary. Then, we perform data polishing (Uno et al., 2015; Uno et al., 2017) and MCE using nysol_python (nysol, 2019; Nakamoto and Hamuro, 2018) to produce a clique count for each WWTL. A WWTL with a large number of cliques has high topic diversity.Finally, we examine whether increases in tweet counts in WWTLs correlate with topic diversity. For each word, we find the WWTL with the maximum tweet count (Tmax). Then, we find the minimum number of non-zero tweets prior to that maximum (Tmin), and call that period between those windows a “keyword rise.” For each keyword rise, we find the number of communities at the beginning and the end of the keyword rise (CTmin and CTmax). We then compute what we call the topic homogeneity factor (THF), using the following formula:THF = ((T_max - T_min) / (T_min)) / ( (C_T_max - C_T_min ) / (C_T_min) )We find that keywords with a THF of 25 or greater are likely to be rumors.ExperimentTo validate our method, we performed an experiment on a data set of around 200 million tweets sent in the three weeks after the 3/11 earthquake in Japan, gathered by the social media company Hottolink (https://www.hottolink.co.jp/english). We knew a number of rumors had spread during the disaster, but were later corrected in official news sources.Our test focused on identifying keywords related to two rumors. The first was about a chemical leak at the Cosmo Oil plant. The second was a widely-retweeted message purporting to be the last words of a dying system administrator, referred to as the “Geek House Asakusa” tweet.To compare the patterns of these known rumor keywords against words not associated with rumors, we arbitrarily selected 150 other words that we expected to exhibit a diverse set of frequencies and topic diversity. We included users’ twitter handles, government agencies, and locations in the affected area. We expected that twitter handles would be mentioned infrequently, and have low topic diversity, while government agencies and affected areas would be mentioned frequently and have high topic diversity. Given the variety among these words’ frequency and topic diversity, we expected that many of them would have either word frequency or topic diversity measures that could confuse our method.ResultsUsing our method, it was easy to differentiate words related to rumors from other words. The term (“Cosmo”) had a THF of 39, and (“Cosmo Oil”) had a THF of 73. Similar results were obtained for (“geek”), with a THF of 41.73. Of the 150 non-rumor keywords, we found that with a threshold of 25.0, only one word was incorrectly classified as a rumor. Given this success, we considered our method to be effective.ConclusionWe have shown that our method can effectively detect keywords likely to be associated with rumors. While we acknowledge that it was tested on a dataset from the past and not on a live tweet stream, in future work, we plan to experiment on a live tweet stream.

They suffer from problems of sustainability not just through obsolescence of technology, but by lack of discoverability and use—sustainability is not just a technological problem but also a social one. The Making and Knowing Project’s development of a Community Crossroads confronts these issues by fostering a collaborative culture in humanities research through digital tools to share not only data and finished products, but also insights into the work behind the scenes, and the integration of research and pedagogy. We question what it means for a scholarly digital product to be “final,” and we broaden the concept of digital sustainability to include not just the technical sense of static data storage, but also a social environment of continued user involvement and dynamic project development. By addressing discoverability, sustainability, and use, the panel responds to the DH2020 themes of the public digital humanities and open data.The Making and Knowing Project (M&K)Since 2014, M&K has studied the intersections of craft making and scientific knowing in the early modern period through the lens of BnF Ms. Fr. 640—a little-known compilation in Middle French by an anonymous “author-practitioner” of roughly 1,000 “recipes” detailing instructions for artistic and technological objects. The manuscript grants insights into the process by which artistic creation yielded insights into the workings of nature. It is a rich and unique example of a “how-to” text—a body of literature whose significance is widely acknowledged, but under-investigated. Over the last 6 years, through crowd- and grad-sourcing in workshops, conferences, and courses, M&K has transcribed, translated, encoded, researched, and annotated the 340-page manuscript. In February 2020, it released a digital critical edition of the entire manuscript: Making and Knowing Project, Pamela H. Smith, Naomi Rosenkranz, Tianna Helena Uchacz, Tillmann Taape, Clément Godbarge, Sophie Pitman, Jenny Boulboullé, Joel Klein, Donna Bilak, Marc Smith, and Terry Catapano, eds., Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France. A Digital Critical Edition and English Translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 (New York: Making and Knowing Project, 2020), https://edition640.makingandknowing.org. M&K will now transform its static Edition into the core of a dynamic Community Crossroads.Product vs. ProcessDespite being defined as modes of scholarship, the digital humanities are often solely represented by products rather than the methodologies employed in their creation; once the collaborative work ceases, the experiential insights are effaced in the finished project and lost to makers of future projects. While the digital humanities offer new modes of dissemination and sustainability of scholarly products, they also provide opportunities for evaluating, refining, and sharing the research process. “Product” also characterizes the scholarly format of a critical edition, which is intended as a definitive version of a manuscript or manuscript corpus. This focus on definitive product works at cross-purposes to one of the greatest potentials of the digital humanities: user-directed, open-ended interactivity that allows scholarship to be built upon and broken down, with the data, platform, and methods reused and reassembled by reader-users in new and inventive ways.A recognition of the tension between the Project’s aim of the definitive critical edition product of Ms. Fr. 640 and the digital humanities process we employed came to a head as students sought to reconstruct the technical “recipes” of the manuscript in a laboratory course, and we came to see that a recipe text is, by its nature, not a definitive text—its processes can never be fully realized in writing, and they are often much harder to comprehend in words than by doing (or by watching, as YouTube has demonstrated), thus extension into the physical and digital realm was necessary. Moreover, Ms. Fr. 640 is a compiled text, and it can be broken down and rearranged in any number of ways, thus forming an ideal text for the reassemblage and reuse that digital format makes possible. The Project aims to foster new uses and new interpretations of this assemblage of recipes through making its components available in a Community Crossroads.The Community Crossroads A series of workshops and courses focusing on pedagogy, research, and outreach will create a community of reader-users of the Edition who take away the Project’s teaching resources, the digital infrastructure for its Edition, and its methods and process, to reuse and reassemble in their own diverse settings—whether digital humanities labs, classrooms, museums, or public programs. Fostering the community, and the new and anticipated uses and discoveries it will engender, will extend and sustain—in the fullest sense of the word—the Edition. The Edition’s methods and process, hidden by its format as a critical edition, will be made visible and disseminated. The Community Crossroads comprises three main components: The M&K “Research and Teaching Companion” will refine and extend the methodologies developed through the creation of its Edition of Fr. 640 and articulate them in a formal implementation guide. The web-based Companion will offer a flexible and adaptable model with resources that scholars, instructors, and students can employ in their own research endeavors or in the classroom. It forms a scalable template for applying and transferring the Project’s key methods: interdisciplinarity and collaboration; pedagogy-driven research and research-driven pedagogy; material literacy through historical reconstructions of past techniques; and the harnessing and utilization of the digital humanities to serve research questions. The “myEdition” community version will make available an open-source, customizable version of the Edition infrastructure, releasing a community software platform in which others can create their own digital critical editions, using the Project’s framework to work with their own data. The “Sandbox Space” will be an interactive online environment for others to 1) explore and experiment with the Project’s data using a variety of digital tools, and 2) add and create their own tools, case studies, and resources resulting from the use of the Template components.The Community Crossroads thus aims to overcome and rethink the most serious challenges in digital humanities projects— discoverability, sustainability, and the effacing of the creation process. Panel SpeakersNAME: Pamela H. SmithAFFILIATION: Columbia UniversityEMAIL: ps2270@columbia.eduTITLE: Insights from the Making of a Digital EditionABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing Project’s five-year initiative to transcribe, translate, and encode the text of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, a sixteenth-century how-to text with almost 1000 entries for a diverse range of art and technical processes, has yielded evidence about the relationship between craft and science in early modern Europe. It has also provided insights about methodology in collaborative work across humanistic studies, the value of integrating hands-on materials-based and digital learning into curricula, and the viability of a model of pedagogy-driven lab-based research outside of the hard sciences. NAME: Nick LaiaconaAFFILIATION: Performant SoftwareEMAIL: nick@performantsoftware.comTITLE: A Case Study in Developing Responsive, Functional Design within Minimal Computing ConstraintsABSTRACT: To ensure its archival preservation by Columbia University Libraries, the Making and Knowing Project required that its Digital Critical Edition be developed as a static site while meeting certain core expectations for functionality. This presented several design challenges for Performant Software, including the need for a responsive layout to reconstruct the text and marginalia of the original folio, the adaptation of Lunr’s basic functionality to generate satisfying searches of middle French transcriptions and contemporary English translation, and the leveraging of the Project’s custom semantic markup toward a meaningful navigation tool. NAME: Terry Catapano & Naomi RosenkranzAFFILIATION: UC Berkeley; Columbia UniversityEMAIL: catapanoth@gmail.com; njr2128@columbia.eduTITLE: Social and Technical Strategies for Sustainability ABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing Project’s Edition, conceived within Columbia’s ethic of minimal computing, has approached sustainability from two directions: technical and social. While the former led to the development of a reduced-functionality, “small-stack” website to minimize dependencies and avoid rapid obsolescence, the latter has mitigated some of the technical limitations by fostering a “Community Crossroads” where public users can interact with the Project’s core data along designated pathways through alternative interfaces (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) or independently through full data downloads to which users can bring their own tools, as well as submission of change suggestions, analyses, and limited-support projects. Among the latter are a suite of augmented reality tools to visualize the Project data, co-developed by Columbia’s Computer Graphic and User Interfaces Lab. At the heart of this Community Crossroads lies Performant Software’s release of a community version of the edition software for adaptation to new texts and projects. NAME: Tianna Helena UchaczAFFILIATION: Texas A&M UniversityEMAIL: tianna.uchacz@gmail.comTITLE: Collaborative Digital Humanities Teaching as a Research Method: A Case Study toward a Research and Teaching CompanionABSTRACT: The Making and Knowing Project practices pedagogy-driven research—a method in which students with no necessary prior training undertake intensive skill-building and then consolidate their newly won competencies through credited work on research tasks and problem-based projects that advance the Project’s overall research goals. Two new DH graduate seminars at Columbia, co-designed and collaboratively taught in 2017 and 2019, yielded edition prototypes and exploratory textual analyses that proved instrumental in the development of the Project’s Digital Critical Edition. This talk presents insights from the design and outcomes of these seminars—insights which stand as one component part of the Project’s Research and Teaching Companion (full release expected July 2021), which will offer a formal articulation of the Project’s principles and methods of pedagogy-driven research as well as a resource set for other scholars, instructors, and practitioners to scale and adapt to their own particular needs. NAME: Tillmann TaapeAFFILIATION: Columbia UniversityEMAIL: tillmann.taape@cantab.netTITLE: How to Transcribe and Translate an Early Modern How-to Text (and how not to)ABSTRACT: This paper reviews the textual scholarship principles, pedagogical strategies, and platform decisions behind the Making and Knowing Project’s five-year, workshop-based effort to transcribe, translate, and encode BnF Ms. Fr. 640, an eclectic collection of practical knowledge in sixteenth-century French whose prose is idiosyncratic, highly technical, and heterogeneous, ranging from terse to rambling. The collaborative and iterative nature of the undertaking, as well as the deliberate entwining of the text-based work with hands-on historical reconstruction of materials and techniques in the laboratory, led to an evolution of the aims and strategies of our transcriptions and translation over time, with implications for workflow from workshop to workshop and for the eventual presentation of the text in the Edition. NAME: Clément GodbargeAFFILIATION: Columbia UniversityEMAIL: clement.godbarge@fulbrightmail.orgTITLE: Le mille-feuille éditorial et ses ramifications théoriquesABSTRACT: L’édition critique numérique du BnF Ms. Fr. 640 offre aux lecteurs pas moins de cinq versions différentes du texte: le fac-similé (en mode image), la transcription diplomatique (xml), la transcription normalisée (xml), une traduction anglaise (xml) ainsi que le rendu final de ces textes sur écran (html/css). Cette prolifération de couches offre de nombreux avantages. Elle permet aux éditions critiques de s’ouvrir à de nouveaux publics tout en invitant le lecteur à explorer les différentes étapes du processus éditorial et de se familiariser avec la source première. Elle rend aussi l’édition plus ouverte et extensible, facilitant à l’avenir la superposition de couches supplémentaires, comme de nouvelles variantes ou traductions du texte. Cette prolifération de couches, cependant, soulève un certain nombre de questions, liées notamment aux conséquences de cette complexification. En effet, comment additionner les couches sans nuire à la cohérence de notre édition?

In particular, we focus on non-textual materials. For textual materials, TEI is the de facto standard. For non-textual materials, we need to find new ways as just collecting images is insufficient. We need to organize images as data for analysis across historical materials.Material and MethodThe tool used for this work is the IIIF Curation Platform (ICP). “Curation” with ICP is a generic method that allows us to gather IIIF images or parts of images and add metadata to each. Curation allows images to be organized as structured and reusable data.A large number of digitized pre-modern Japanese books are being released by multiple Japanese institutions. We used ICP to organize 1255 images from eight guidebooks in the Edo period then organized 2489 images from the Edo shopping guidebook.Findings and DiscussionThe current curated data confirmed the relationship between famous places and commerce. Presently, our finding reconfirms previous studies. The Asakusa area has many shops around Sensoji Temple today. However, there were many medicine dealers in one corner of Nihonbashi area unlike today (Figure 1–2).By applying our method to Edo period publications, we not only structure useful information for our research, but also provide reusable data for other researches.Figure 1: Nihonbashi area illustration curated from Edo guidebooks.

Compared to the novel, short fiction is understudied in the digital humanities. This gap can be attributed to both the novel’s role as the more popular (and prestigious) publication form in fiction and the added cost of separating collections into their constituent parts. While it is easier to study novels, novels are an insufficient proxy for studying the greater landscape of fiction. Many voices are lost if we limit our focus to novels. Moreover, the formation of science fiction as a distinct genre in English is directly tied to the rise of pulp magazines: a medium that focused on short fiction. Studying science fiction anthologies will allow us to find subtle trends in the history of the genre, and make quantitative comparisons between the structure of short stories and novels.But accessing short fiction is difficult due to copyright, collection practices, and printing formats. Much of the work in science fiction falls into the mid-to-late 20th-century ""dark zone"" where it is too new to be public domain but too old to exist in born-digital format. The existence of large-scale repositories of digitized library collections, such as HathiTrust, offer the possibility to begin analyzing short fiction through non-expressive data views. The problem, then, is segmentation. The fundamental unit of HathiTrust is the volume, and little to no sub-volume structure is recorded in either HathiTrust metadata or the catalog records of source libraries. We therefore focus on identifying the boundaries of stories from non-expressive page-level data.Data. We identify 690 volumes within the HathiTrust Research Center’s Extracted Features Dataset (EF) (Capitanu et al. 2016) representing 529 science fiction anthologies published between 1940 and 2009. For each page in a volume, EF data segments headers, body text, and footers, and provides the text and part-of-speech of every word token in those segments, but does not preserve order within segments. For example, a header page of Nalo Hopkinson's ""A Habit of Waste"" within Women of Other Worlds: Excursions Through Science Fiction and Feminism is represented as [Hopkinson_NNP \_JJ habit_NN waste_NN of_IN Nalo_NNP]. Note this data can include OCR errors, such as ""\"" instead of ""A"".To validate our approach we also collect metadata from The Internet Speculative Fiction Database (ISFDB).1 For anthologies, ISFDB typically provides the (edition-level) starting page for each short fiction entry, along with its title, author, length type (e.g. novella), and a list of other anthologies it has been published in, allowing us to link copies of the same story in different anthologies. We created a training set linking 68 EF volumes to their ISFDB metadata at the page level. This volume set represents 34 anthologies: two per anthology.Segmentation. We treat the segmentation task as a supervised classification problem, in which the goal is to predict whether a given page is the beginning of a new segment. We evaluate a number of features for segmenting stories. For simplicity, we assume that every page corresponds to only one story. A reasonable starting point for identifying story transitions is to identify pages with unusually few tokens.Figure 1: Page lengths can reflect actual transitions (vertical lines).We note that there are often pairs of unusually short pages at segment boundaries, where one story ends mid-page and a new one begins in the middle of the next page. Since the absolute number of words per page varies from volume to volume, we normalize the length of each page to a number of standard deviations from the mean for the volume. For each page we also provide the deviation of the previous and following pages.Headers and footers might also be helpful since they can contain short fiction titles and authors. We find that headers are much more common for science fiction anthologies than footers. There are 619 volumes with many headers, but only 20 with many footers. To allow for OCR errors, instead of exact string matches we measure the Jaccard similarity of character trigrams between headers. As headers often alternate, we record the maximum similarity of the five previous and subsequent pages and the maximum of the five subsequent pages. If boundary information is in the header, it becomes much easier to verify transitions given word statistics since these segments are very short.Figure 2: Similarity of odd page headers can also mark transitions, but sometimes they're absent.Analysis. In addition to raw features from page length and header similarity, we add a small set of pairwise product features to represent interactions between variables: length * prev_length, length * next_length, and the product of those two products; prev_header_similarity * next_header_similarity. For analysis, we use 34 labeled volumes representing distinct anthologies. For 20 cross-validation splits we hold out 20% of these volumes for evaluation. Using all features, we find that 58% +/- 11.8 of labeled boundaries match a predicted boundary. 63% +/- 10.9 of labeled boundaries have a predicted boundary within one page. Boundary predictions are conservative, with 93% +/- 3.7 of predictions within one page of a labeled boundary. The difficulty of the task varies between volumes, often because of the quality of headers, OCR problems, and idiosyncratic boundaries. Without product features, performance drops to 37% exact, 44% of labels within one page of a prediction, and 79% of predictions within one page of a label. With only raw length features these numbers are 14%, 17%, and 67%; header features alone are precise but limited, at 21%, 26%, and 78%. Results for the other 34 labeled volumes are similar.Applying the full model trained with all labeled volumes to the complete set of 690 anthologies results in just over 10,000 predicted segments. Not all of these correspond to stories, but even with this noisy sample we have substantially improved our ability to access short-form science fiction.Future Work. All of our current metrics rely on the formatting of pages. We predict that the content of stories may also have clues, with the names of characters and settings changing between stories. Although we expect these methods to be less successful, they will be useful indicators for when an identified segment needs to be further divided and will work for a wider range of publishing formats. The fact that product features did so well indicates that structured prediction models for sequences and multi-layer neural networks might improve performance further.","laurejt@cs.cornell.edu, mimno@cornell.edu",Short Presentation

By the 21st century, according to figures in the Irish Emigration Patterns and Citizens Abroad report published in 2017 by the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, an estimated 70 million people worldwide claimed some Irish descent, that largely maintain a connection with Irish cultural identity and heritage.The online project Historic Graves (https://historicgraves.com/) capitalized on this global phenomenon, putting together a worldwide community of more than 15,000 users, collaborating in generating a nationwide genealogical dataset. The project began in 2010, from an idea of John Tierney developed by Maurizio Toscano, both still at the forefront of the initiative. It started and still runs as a community focused grassroots heritage project, where local community groups living in Ireland are trained in low-cost high-tech field survey of historic graveyards and recording of their own oral histories. In almost a decade, historicgraves.com published online more than 800 graveyards, recording at least a photo and the location of 99,235 graves and collaboratively transcribing the details of 199,851 people, and counting.Community co-production happens within a freely available online platform, created for the transcription of memorial epitaphs. Training workshops are offered to local communities interested in contributing to surveying and transcribing historic graveyards. The combination of online interaction with local workshops and meetings works best in terms of ensuring meaningful participation. Data gathering and management procedures have proved to be essential on two fronts: data collected in the field is normally available online in short time; on the website, memorials’ transcription is unmediated and immediately available to share. Instant publication proved to be highly engaging for the volunteer groups involved: they see immediate results for their work and are willing to share them with family and friends living abroad. Each local community can then download individual datasets of their own records, as tabular Open Data. The global community of users takes responsibility for quality control and completeness.In 2018, the project has received a Heritage Council grant, that supported the upgrading of the online platform (backend and frontend), and it has been part of the initiative European Year of Cultural Heritage (#EuropeForCulture). From a technical point of view, data, code and layout have been upgraded from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, with a plan to move to BackdropCMS or Drupal 9 in late 2021, when both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 will reach ""End of Life"".The Historic Graves project is fundamentally a Public History project, originated from local communities and that constantly relies on them to grow, solve ethical issues and stay sustainable. Technologies, and the Web in particular, have played a big role, both enabling remote transcriptions and stimulating participation, although they never been the focus of the initiative. Additionally, in line with public digital humanities principles, the project has always been open to participation, well beyond the academy, growing as a group of networked and engaged communities, not just as a repository for content.","maurizio.toscano@gmail.com, john@historicgraves.com",Poster

De hecho, representan una tendencia destacada en la investigación, ya sea como campo de estudio que como tema de financiación preferente. Al mismo tiempo, por su novedad, están siendo objeto de escrutinio por parte de la comunidad investigadora y de las instituciones gubernamentales que financian la investigación. El objetivo del estudio ha sido identificar a los investigadores que trabajan en el campo de las HD en España y explorar su financiación, sus afiliaciones institucionales, las temáticas de investigación y los recursos digitales desarrollados.En el pasado se han promovido iniciativas similares, que han producido mapeos centrados en el ámbito internacional o nacional, algunos de los cuales siguen disponibles en línea, con diferencias que van desde la cobertura geográfica hasta el tipo de datos mapeados (Ortega; Eunice-Gutiérrez, 2014; Romero-Frías; Del-Barrio-García, 2014). Otros estudios sobre este tema han optado por un enfoque diferente, utilizando la bibliografía u otras fuentes para identificar las etapas más relevantes en la evolución y consolidación de esta disciplina en España (Rojas-Castro, 2013; González-Blanco, 2013; Spence; González-Blanco, 2014; Baraibar-Echeverria, 2014). El presente trabajo no pretende ser una revisión histórica exhaustiva, sino ofrecer una visión complementaria y actualizada del panorama de las HD en España, tomando en consideración datos recientes y fuentes de información no explotadas anteriormente.Materiales y métodosA continuación se describen los resultados de la investigación sobre el estado actual de las infraestructuras de investigación digital en España, entendidas como la combinación e integración entre los recursos de información digital, las herramientas analíticas y de visualización y la comunidad activa de investigadores, colaborando a través de proyectos de investigación, financiados por el sector público o privado. Por esta razón, hemos subdividido el objeto de la investigación en cinco entidades principales, concretamente: investigadores, proyectos, recursos, bibliografía y cursos de posgrado.Nuestra metodología de recopilación de datos ha tenido una doble vertiente. Por un lado, hemos seleccionado manualmente información disponible en línea a partir de congresos, seminarios, convocatorias temáticas, mapas participativos, etc. Por el otro, hemos extraído información a partir de bases de datos existentes: publicaciones científicas en el campo de las HD presentes en Dialnet y en ÍnDICEs-CSIC y proyectos de investigación financiados a través de la Agencia Estatal de Investigación, seleccionados a través de una serie de palabras claves (Figura 1).El volumen total de registros recopilados ha sido 1.359, distribuidos de la siguiente manera: 577 investigadores; 368 proyectos; 88 recursos; 9 cursos de posgrado y 8 revistas científicas. El conjunto de datos analizados se encuentra disponible en Acceso Abierto (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3893546), junto con los Jupiter Notebooks y el código Python para reproducir los análisis.Figura 1. Fuentes de datos utilizadas en la investigación.ResultadosEntre los investigadores identificados, 305 son varones (52,9%) y 272 mujeres (47,1%): una proporción que, comparada con la proporción de género entre los investigadores de España en todas las disciplinas (61,2% de varones y 38,8% de mujeres) o limitada a las Humanidades (59,8% de varones y 40,2% de mujeres), refleja una presencia femenina significativamente mayor de la esperada.La clasificación de los investigadores por disciplinas, 19 en total, muestra una amplia variedad, con una clara prevalencia de filólogos (36%), seguidos por historiadores (16,5%) e informáticos (10,8%).El análisis de las conexiones entre disciplinas y temas de investigación (Figura 2) revela cinco grandes grupos disciplinarios: Historia (32% de los nodos), Filología (24%), Comunicación (20%), Ciencias de la Computación (17,3%) y Documentación (6,7%). Las Ciencias de la Computación, a pesar de ser la cuarta comunidad en términos de nodos, resulta ser la disciplina relacionada con el mayor número de temas de investigación (13,3%).Figura 2. Análisis de redes de disciplinas y temas de investigación. El tamaño de los nodos corresponde al número total de conexiones, el color a la comunidad y el grosor de las aristas al grado de conectividad entre parejas de nodos.Según la afiliación institucional, la mitad de los investigadores (49,2%) pertenece a un total de nueve instituciones, mientras que la otra mitad se encuentra dispersa entre 84 diferentes centros (http://sl.ugr.es/DHmap).La afiliación a departamentos (Figura 3) muestra un patrón mucho más variado en cada institución: por ejemplo, el peso relativo de la Filología es mayor en la Complutense de Madrid o en Santiago de Compostela con respecto a Granada, donde por otra parte se aprecia mucha variedad, con investigadores procedentes de 13 departamentos.Figura 3.

Aebischer 2003; Detken 2009; Dustagheer, Woods 2017; Habscheid et al. 2018). However, there are hardly any quantitative studies of SD so far (except of Sperantov 1998 who analysed Russian tragedies).Usually, dramas consist of two types of text: Spoken Text (ST) and SD, where SD often consist of rather formal instructions. To complement existing quantitative approaches to drama, we will profile SD as an object of research in digital literary studies. To this purpose, we will give an exploratory analysis of quantitative features of SD using 384 German plays. Subsequently, we will characterise the development of SD over a period of 200 years, using the hypothesis of a “tendency towards epification“ (“Episierungstendenz“, Szondi 1956) as an interpretative framework.2. Corpus and WorkflowOur corpus is based on the drama collection GerDraCor (Fischer et al. 2019). Even though literary studies has not yet reached a consensus on a definition of SD (Dustagheer, Woods 2017: 1–16), there are relatively uncontroversial (typographical) conventions what should be regarded as SD (Tonger-Erk 2018: 431–434). Digital editions using TEI (including GerDraCor) encode SD using the <stage> element.Of the 474 plays available in GerDraCor, we removed librettos and 3 plays without SD, which yields a corpus of 384 plays that are pre-processed using the DramaNLP package1. The package employs the Stanford PoS tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003; STTS tagset: Schiller et al. 1999) and mate lemmatizer (Björkelund et al., 2000) separately on the text types ST and SD. The resulting data is analysed with the DramaAnalysis R package (Reiter 2019).3. Exploratory Data AnalysisThe median number of tokens is 1.639 in SD and 20.270 in ST (Fig. 01), so on average SD takes up 7.48% of the entire text. Additionally, sentences in SD are on average only about half as long as in ST.Figure 1: Distribution of token count and mean sentence lengthSD and ST also differ in the proportions of certain parts of speech (POS). While SD has a higher percentage of adjectives and named entities, ST has a higher percentage of verbs and pronouns (Fig. 02).Figure 2: Portion of selected POS2A closer look can be taken by differentiating fine-grained POS tags of adjectives and verbs (Fig. 03). Compared to ST, SD are about named entities (NE) doing something (VVFIN) in a specific way (ADJD), while they lack the rhetorics of addressing (PRO) and modality (VMFIN), which are more characteristic for ST.Fig. 03: Portion of selected fine-grained POS4. EpificationWhile an intense discussion about (Brechtian) ""Epic Theater"" emerges in the aftermath of the ‘crisis of drama’ around 1890, “epification” in recent narratological and semiotical studies is conceptualised as a specific ""mediation of the representation of events by a narrator-like instance"" (cf. Weber 2017: 209). In contrast to the SD of 'classical' drama, primarily functioning as an “instruction” (Issacaroff 1988), the epified SD “seems to be incorporating qualities of the novel and the plastic arts” (Suchy 1991:80).Consequently, we characterise the development of SD in our corpus with respect to such an understanding of epification, with five concrete indicators:the proportion of SD in the total text increases, giving more 'word space' to a potential narrative voice;sentences in SD get longer, thus becoming similar to SP;SD and ST converge in their POS distributions, so that SD approaches ST in the 'verbal gesture‘;words describing a location increase in SD, indicating a more concrete shaping of the diegetic world by a narrative voice;SD becomes more emotional, indicating an increase in evaluations and (possible) internal focalisations, both understood as privileges of the narrator's voice.While there is almost no change in the number of tokens in ST, their number in SD increases over time, leading to a substantial increase in the SD/ST ratio (Fig. 04). The same holds for the mean sentence length in SD, which in several dramas 'around 1900' even considerably exceeds the mean sentence length in ST (i.e. ratio over one; Fig. 05).Figure 04: Historical distribution of token countFigure 05: Historical distribution of mean sentence lengthWhile verbs (Fig. 02) and attributive adjectives (Fig. 03) are synchronously more frequently found in ST, historically differentiated data shows a convergence of the percentages in SD and ST (Fig. 06). Conversely, the proportion of named entities in SD decreases (Fig. 06). Also noteworthy is the convergence of the proportion of relative pronouns in SD and ST (Fig. 06), which suggests an increase in sentence complexity in SD. Overall, SD and ST become more similar over time.Figure 06: Historical distribution for selected POSIn order to explore 'topologisation', we defined a lexicon of topological terms. 3 As Fig. 07 shows, a considerable increase in topological words in SD can be observed, which can be interpreted as a more concrete topological order of the diegesis on the stage.Figure 07: Historical distribution for topological wordsFinally, using word-related information from GermaNet 11 (Hamp/Feldweg 1997), we calculated the percentage of words (adjectives, nouns, verbs) from the semantic field 'GEFUEHL' (emotions). As Fig. 08 shows, there is also a clear increase in such words in SD.Figure 08: Historical distribution for ‘emotion‘ words5. ConclusionOur examinations outlined SD as a relevant object of research for a quantitative history of drama. We demonstrated that SD is a text layer that differs from ST in several aspects. By examining the historical development of SD, we have shown a transformation of SD between 1730 and 1930, which we linked back to the “tendency towards epification“ in German drama. Further research should develop more complex linguistic operationalisations of epification, and be extended to plays in other languages.","trilcke@uni-potsdam.de, contact@christopherkittel.eu, nils.reiter@ims.uni-stuttgart.de, daria.maximova.m@gmail.com, ffischer@hse.ru",Long Presentation

Beginning with the MEDS database, our project applies a Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network to produce synthetic faces. Aesthetically, the portraits generated resemble eugencist Francis Galton’s “composite portraits” of different races that he deployed in the 19th century. The project is a data visualization project: using machine learning techniques, we have been able to surface what is the “most common” type of face within the dataset; that the portraits generated are primarily of African American males speaks to the types of faces over-represented in these virtual spaces. Further, from this data visualization, “This Criminal Does not Exist” is indicative of contemporary State applications of FRS, bringing to light the clear biases inherent in the dataset, biases further perpetuated through algorithms trained on these types of dataset.This response is made from a digital humanities perspective that combines principles of ethical data annotation and classification with critical making. In particular, this paper addresses how digital humanities can contribute potential solutions to the ethics of studying and surfacing problematic databases.More specifically, drawing from the the impacts of 19th century pseudo-science like eugenics, phrenology, physiognomy, and signaletics, our project “This Criminal Does Not Exist” signals another potential set of tactics and research creation paths that simultaneously educates the public about the nature of problematic facial datasets, alongside producing arguments about the ethical implications about such databases and their in-built classification practices. Further, this paper explores how digital humanities scholars can provide a public critical engagement with such databases that is grounded in humanized narrative, that does not further replicate and/or ingrain the intersectional and carceral biases of the databases.Our research begins by recounting how the contemporary study and fears surrounding FRS has been largely focused on large scale corporate- and state-led surveillance apparatuses and their impacts on users’ data privacy. This work, exemplified by scholars like Ann Cavoukian and her framework of Privacy by Design, is undeniably useful; similarly, research by surveillance studies theorists like David Lyon and Gary Marx has contributed greatly to advocating for responsible building and application of technologies like FRS. The initial scholarship into the problematic construction of FRS has been driven, in large part, by a wealth of research and reporting about the known inherent biases of the technology, which, as the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology’s report “The Perpetual Line-up” insists, “face recognition may be least accurate for those it is most likely to affect: African Americans.” The technology’s consistent optimization, in construction and application, for white male faces is especially troubling as the technology moves from being surveilling, national security, and law enforcement tactics, into the ubiquitous, and far more normalized, activities of intervening in job interviews, the monitoring of low incoming housing, and the granting of bank loans. These last three FRS tasks are examples of what Safiya Noble, in her text Algorithms of Oppression, would give as examples of “technological redlining,” which she explains is the use of algorithms and big data to “reinforce oppressive social relationships and enact new modes of racial profiling.”  Given this, how might digital humanities scholars make the contents of these databases public and available for wider scrutiny and potential regulation while not replicating the dangerous practices that initially led to the construction and implementation of such data? One effective example is artist Trevor Paglen’s collaboration with scholar Kate Crawford titled ImageNet Roulette. The project trains an app on the massive ImageNet database’s of images labeled in the “person” category. The result is a surfacing of how “ImageNet contains a number of problematic, offensive, and bizarre categories. Hence, the results ImageNet Roulette returns often draw upon those categories. That is by design: we want to shed light on what happens when technical systems are trained using problematic training data.” Their accompanying essay, “Excavating AI: The Politics of Images in Machine Learning Training Sets,” expands further in labelling their own work as an “archeology of datasets”: “we have been digging through the material layers, cataloguing the principles and values by which something was constructed, and analyzing what normative patterns of life were assumed, supported, and reproduced. By excavating the construction of these training sets and their underlying structures, many unquestioned assumptions are revealed.” Digital humanities scholars are extremely well suited to take up similar archeological projects, in FRS or other AI- and machine learning-aided environments, as the discipline’s focus on ethics, digital tools and humanities-based close-reading techniques grant scholars the abilities to take up the urgent problems of FRS’s everyday applications.","artucker@yorku.ca, kieran.ramnarine@ryerson.ca",Short Presentation

A digital edition of Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo's Divertimento per li Regazzi Abstract The paper presents a digital edition of Giovanii Domenico Tiepolo's drawing series Divertimento per li Regazzi. The series depict Pulcinella, a well-known character from the Commedia dell’Arte in different situations and can be interpreted as kind of a life story of the character. However, unlike in 'normal' narratives, the single drawings can not be ordered in one linear sequence but offer the recipient a variety of possibilities to arrange different stories. To model and visualize this open structure we draw on the CIDOC conceptual reference model and discuss a possible display for the front-end of the edition. Thus, the main contribution of the paper lies in the exploration of new ways for a digital presentation of narrative drawings series at the intersection of art history and narratologyIntroductionThe drawing series Divertimento per li Regazzi created by the Venetian artist GiovanniDomenico Tiepolo in the late 18th century lies at the intersection of narrative and figurative art: It features scenes that depict Pulcinella, the well-known character from the Commedia dell’Arte, in what appears to be different stages of his life, his birth, his adolescence or his death. Thus, the series can be ‘read’ as a kind of life story of Pulcinella. However, other than in linear narratives, the exact sequence of the drawings is unclear and even inconsistent. Furthermore, it is subverted by a playful arrangement of motifs that establish paradigmatic relationships between single drawings of the series or interlink them to works of other artists.This richness of possible relations is hard to grasp with conventional means: In the printed catalogue by Adelheid Gealt, which still builds the base for scholarly research on the series, the drawings are – necessarily – presented in a static sequence that suggests a specific order of the pictures. As current endeavors in the field of textual scholarship have shown, such limitations of the printed media can be overcome with the help of digital editions that are able to present material in a dynamic way. Thus, a transfer of these methods on figurative objects seems promising.In our paper we want to report on our digital edition of the Divertimento, which takes into account the potential openness of the series and at the same time shows itsinterconnectedness. For this purpose, we establish a data model that draws on the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model, which offers a solid, yet variable enough framework. Furthermore, we suggest a workflow that includes the conceptualization of a frontend that meets the requirements of a flexible display of the Divertimento. Therefore, the main contribution of our paper lies in the combination of different methods to establish new ways to present material at the intersection of textual and figurative art.Divertimento per li Regazzi The Divertimento consists of 104 drawings that depict Pulcinella in different situations. The individual Pulcinella-figures show enough resemblance to suggest that the series can be understood as a story of Pulcinella’s life from the cradle to the grave. However, because of numerous inconsistencies it is not possible to interconnect all the drawings into one concise narrative. E.g., there are two drawings that show Pulcinella getting executed in two different ways and even one more drawing that shows his pardon. Thus, in contrast to ‘normal’ narratives, there is no clearly intended arrangement of a single plot. Instead, the series offers a wide range of possible stories, to be constructed by the recipient. Finding a way to handle these possibilities demands the application of specific perspectives that arrange the material in a manageable manner. E.g., from a narratological point of view, not all of the possible arrangements appear to be reasonable: Biographic readings of the series would suggest that drawings, which show Pulcinella as a child, should be sorted before pictures that show him as grown-up.Furthermore, Pulcinella’s life story is supplemented by a paradigmatic dimension that is established by the repetition of specific motifs (e.g, several drawings contain a pot of gnocchi that suggests relations between those drawings). And finally, these internalparadigmatic relations are supplemented by external links to other works of art, motifs or practices. The scene that depicts the shooting of Pulcinella, e.g., clearly refers to the Grandes Misères de la guerre of Jacques Callot, a contextualization, which sheds new light on the drawings.This structure leads to several requirements for our edition:- The goal of the edition should not be to reconstruct a single linear sequence, but rather to show possible links that are suggested by the series and enable the recipient to find diverse ways through the narrative space of the Divertimento.- To achieve this goal, a data model is needed that provides a logical narrative framework without determining a fixed sequence.- The data model has to take into account syntagmatic as well as paradigmatic relations.- It should be capable to grasp internal as well as external references that reach out into the semantic web. Workflow. To express the possible relations between the drawings we employ a graph data model by using RDF-triples and the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model. More concretely, we draw on the OWL-based version of the CIDOC, the Erlangen-CRM, which we adapted with the help of the ontology-editor Protégé. The triples are stored in a graph database (GraphDB).We use the ARC2 framework to process SPARQL-queries in php and transform the results in HTML. To establish a link to Linked Open Data resources we use authority files like the iconclass classification system[10]. Modeling the data in CIDOC-CRM. A core concept of our approach is the modeling of our data in CIDOC-CRM, a top level ontology widely used in different contexts of the Digital Humanities. We stick to the CIDOC-model not only for standardization purposes, but also because its event-centered structure is particularly apt for our goals. With the help of CIDOC, a flexible chronological structure can be established, which does not have to stick to a fixed sequence of single artefacts, but rather uses the notion of a ‘virtual’ life story to group the drawings of the Divertimento. Thus, the whole life story of Pulcinella (E4_Period) is segmented into subgroups of E5_Events (e.g., Pulcinella’s birth, childhood, or death) and E7_Activities (which further specify the events). E5_Events and E7_Activities are brought into a chronological order by using the relation P120_occurs_before.Figure 1 shows the two red E5_Event-nodes ‘Pulcinella’s birth and childhood’ and‘Pulcinella’s professions’ and their connections. Yellow nodes represent the single drawings that are assigned to the E5_Events (note that some drawings like image 8, “the young Pulcinella observes the laborers”, can be assorted to two events). The two E5_Event-nodes are connected by various relations (amongst them P120_occurs_before) through E7_Activity-nodes (colored in light blue) that subdivide the events further. Both E5_Eventnodes are also connected to the overall E4_Period-node ‘Pulcinella’s life story’ in purple. Front end. Figure 2 shows a prototype of the front end for the edition. It focuses on a single drawing in the middle and presents possible following events in a carousel in the right column, where the respective drawings can be selected to add up to an individual ‘story’. An overview of this story is presented in thumbnails in the left column.The featured motifs of the drawing are listed beneath and can be selected to jump tointernal or external pictures that hold the same motifs, thus employing the paradigmatic relationships. Since all motifs are stored with their respective iconclass-ID, a further contextualization with resources of the semantic web can be achieved.","rostislav.tumanov@ikg.uni-stuttgart.de, viehhauser@ilw.uni-stuttgart.de, feldmann.alina@gmail.com, barbarakoller94@web.de",Short Presentation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a crucial role not only in computer science and robotics but also in the communication between machines and machines, and between humans and machines. With the rise of this new interactive space, it is becoming ever more critical to ask what role intercultural communications will play in this complex correlation. Does culture still matter in the era of AI?To explore this question, we mobilize Geert Hofstede’s 6D cultural model (2010, 2020), one of the most comprehensive models for describing a country's characteristics and apply it to the Negative Attitudes Towards Robots Scale (NARS) (Nomura, Kanda, & Suzuki, 2006), a study which has been conducted in six countries (China, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, United States) to measure human attitude towards robots within the cross-cultural perspective (Bartneck et al, 2005). In this paper, we understand culture as Hofstede’s ‘National Culture’ which he defines as “the collective programming of the mind distinguishing the members of one group or category of people from others” (Hofstede Insights 2020). The NARS scale provides a foundation that has been used in several studies to measure human attitudes towards humanoid robots (Riek et al, 2010). Together these two approaches provide a cross-cultural framework for analyzing an emerging era of communications in the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).Figure 1: Hofstede’s 6D Cultural Model - Country ComparisonFigure 2: Negative Attitudes Towards Robots Scale (NARS) - Country ComparisonOur initial findings show there is a correlation between a country’s ‘Individualism’, ‘Power Distance’ and its attitude towards HRI. For instance, highly individual societies with less power inequality, like the United States, have more positive attitudes towards HRI when compared to collectivist cultures, like Mexico. One exception is China; this could be due to the country’s high level of technology manufacturing involving industrial robots. Another of our findings is that countries that are ‘Long-term Oriented’, such as Netherlands and Germany, are less negative in regard to HRI, compared to those who focus on the short term, like Mexico. The exception here is the United States; this could be that despite the States’ ‘Short-term orientation’, it has a long history of interacting with technology and robots. A tendency also exists between a country’s ‘Uncertainty Avoidance’ and their attitude towards the social influence of robots, with a greater desire to avoid uncertainty correlating to more negative attitudes toward robots’ social influence. In terms of attitude towards ‘Emotions’ in interaction with robots, a correlation with Hofstede’s 6D cultural model was not identified.As a pilot study combining Hofstede’s 6D cultural model and NARS, our aim with this study is to identify possible empirical correlations that can then be supported through a larger multi-country study evaluating AI and HRI through a cross-cultural lens. Our critical comparative analysis illustrates that, though technological development cannot be contained within a country's territorial boundaries, culture is a crucial variable in HRI. A cultural and qualitative perspective is needed in future studies of HRI to understand what role intercultural communications will play in this complex interaction.","stuncer2@uottawa.ca, ddboulou@uottawa.ca",Lightning

Indeed, AI is becoming capable of capturing the unique essence that makes us “human”: storytelling. Humans are intrinsically storytellers and able to express themselves through stories (Fisher, 1987; Frank, 2012). Moreover, people have always learnt about themselves and made sense of the rest of the world through narratives (Ebanda de B'béri, 2006; Tunçer, 2018). However, in recent years, AI-generated games and articles have already started to emerge (Fitch, 2019). While AI is able to exceed certain functions of natural human intelligence as it gains self-learning capacity in repetitive or analytical tasks, it may have the potential to harness the persuasive capabilities of storytelling.What will become of humanity if AI can perform such “human” talents as storytelling? Indeed, some have gone as far as declaring that AI will be the greatest danger to humanity (Bramer, 2015). While other scholars have already hailed the arrival of the posthuman era (Wolfe, 2010; Braidotti, 2013) with such advances as neural nets that allow biological (human) and silicon-based artificial brain cells to communicate with each other (Serb et al., 2020). What will the future look like if AI can harness the influential potential of storytelling? What would be the story landscape in this era of posthumanism?We argue these questions through the lens of persuasion and Transportation Narrative Theory, which refers to the experience of an individual being transported into a world created by a narrative (Green & Brock, 2000; Green, 2004). According to this theory, several mechanisms comprise the transportation experience: reduced counterarguing, connections with characters, heightened perceptions of realism, the formation of vivid mental imagery, and emotional engagement (Green & Fitzgerald, 2017). Through this transportation experience, a narrative can influence an individual’s attitudes and beliefs. We argue that if or when AI develops the ability to create its own narratives, it will also have the potential to create transportation experiences and, thus, influence all aspects of human life.","stuncer2@uottawa.ca, ddboulou@uottawa.ca",Lightning

This project could not have taken place without the principles of open data being embraced by the digital classicist community and the EDH team.Aims Inscriptions are one of our most important sources for the ancient world, covering a vast number of subjects, monument types, geographical areas and periods [2]. There were several stages in their planning: the preparation of the surface, drafting of the layout of the text, possibly the filling in of letters with brush strokes, and finally the carving [3, 4]. Our interest is in the drafting: were Roman craftsmen in different regions working to defined sets of planning ‘modules’ which could be scaled up or down? Did the stonecutter have freedom to influence the design after drafting? Does this vary by time or place? Could we even begin to identify the work of specific workshops [5]?MethodologyThe project applies a neural network, investigating Neural ODEs [6] and extending the model for this image processing case. We investigate whether the model can learn effectively, and address the development of a new basis for training Neural ODEs using a mathematical method, invariant embedding. Once characters in an image have been localised, we analyse the regularity of their size, shape, spacing, position and orientation, and the overall shape of their outline.SummaryImproving our understanding of the planning out of inscriptions is important not only from the perspective of ancient craftsmanship. Inscriptions are frequently fragmentary, and epigraphers have to determine what letters would have been present on the missing sections. Reconstructions of inscriptions influence our interpretation of ancient sites, so being able to predict accurately the positioning of the letters is crucial. We seek to initiate valuable conversations with DH specialists in other fields which may influence the future direction of our investigations.","c.tupman2@exeter.ac.uk, j.t.christmas@exeter.ac.uk, d.kangin@exeter.ac.uk",Poster

These advances are mostly concentrated in prose fiction. Prose is more straightforward and verbose than poetry (Rhody, 2012), even if the problems of poetics are tractable for forms from Victorian sonnets to free verse (Houston, 2015; Bories et al., n.d.). Poetry is rarely straightforward: it uses words that resonate with other words, that complicate ideas and change meanings, that are there for idiomatic, rhythmic, allusive, formal, tonal, thematic, semantic, or idiosyncratic reasons. In sum, there are so many reasons that poets use particular words that machines struggle to model their topics statistically.We use a recurrent neural network (RNN) for classifying sonnets, which are formally defined (14-line rhyming poems) but which also exhibit generic qualities of arguments, subjects/topics, tones, moods, and forms of address. We have built a computational model capable of scoring any text for its formal and generic resemblance to accepted criteria, for scoring its “sonnetness.” Our goal is to find poems that have the generic features of sonnets, but not the formal criteria like a Petrarchan or Shakespearean rhyme scheme. These results will address our core question: to what degree sonnets, both individually and as a category, are defined formally or generically.MethodsThe standard distinction between Petrarchan and Shakespearean sonnets is based on rhyme schemes, but we set out to see if machine learning could define features that we couldn’t see. We began with diction, or word choices that constitute both form and genre; the results were so promising that we extended the dimensionality of our model to incorporate four other dimensions: sound, rhyming, punctuation, and lineation. This identified a set of poems that we would never have considered.Results / DiscussionIn this presentation we will address why we began with early sonnets, which set conventions to which later English sonnets respond. We moved from a hand-transcribed test set to a corpus of 253,000 English-language poems from 12 centuries. Now we are expanding to two larger corpora: the 70,000 English texts printed before 1700, in the Early English Books Online - Text Creation Partnership (EEBO-TCP) corpus; and to the 334,000 volumes of literature in the HATHI Trust Digital Library.In our past work (Ullyot and Bradley, 2018), we concluded that exceptions to the rules make language poetic. Poetry is deliberately irregular. It does not obey rules, it sets and then resets them. By expanding the canon of sonnets, our current project will unsettle critics’ orthodox ideas about them.","ullyot@ucalgary.ca, Adam.Bradley@uoit.ca",Short Presentation

We demonstrate how the Golden Agents digital humanities research infrastructure can play an intersecting role as intermediary data provider between these distributed collections in the reconciliation, disambiguation and deduplication of data by taking their provenance into account. To this end we analyse an art historical case we call ‘The Montias Case’, with data from three different sources: the Getty Provenance Index, the Frick Collection, and the notarial acts of the Amsterdam City Archives. In the 1980s, John Michael Montias (1928-2005) began to compile a database containing records of ownership of works of art of the Dutch Golden Age. To this end he also selected records from the Amsterdam City Archives using inventories dated 1597-1681. In 1985 and 1987, Montias was invited to the Getty Research Institute to automate his work and incorporate it into the Getty Provenance Index. When his collaboration with the Getty concluded around 1990, Montias continued his project and donated his work to the Frick Art Reference Library. Both datasets were enriched by others. The Getty Provenance Index and the Frick Collection have now two partially overlapping datasets with a shared provenance that are in need of deduplication/disambiguation to fully exploit them for art-historical research. The Getty Research Institute and the Golden Agents consortium set up an experiment in 2019 to reconcile the Montias data with their provenance and enrichments to their original source: the notarial acts. This reconciliation via the Golden Agents infrastructure is necessary because the Amsterdam City Archives due to their public mission only index person and geographical names, but not the art objects that Montias listed that we need as researchers.We first link the inventories from the Getty Provenance Index and the Frick Collection to their corresponding notarial deeds. Additionally, we deduplicate the names indexed in these data sources and identify people utilizing the Lenticular Lenses II tool (Idrissou et al., 2018, 2019) in development within the Golden Agents project. Then we link the individual items indexed in the Montias database to the transcription of the historical archival source. The Web Annotation Model is used as a data model for the text and serves both modelling and presentational purposes. This allows us to link and to validate the exact piece of text indicated by coordinates on the scan where a certain object is listed and to present it for instance in a IIIF-environment. The thesauri AAT and TGN, and ICONCLASS help in describing these items in a standardized way. Finally, we demonstrate how, in line with the goals of the Golden Agents and the remodel of the Getty Provenance Index as Linked Open Data projects, the results of the Montias Case can be relevant for data reconciliation and for modeling the provenance of distributed heterogeneous cultural heritage collections for (re-)use in digital humanities research projects in general.","l.vanwissen@uva.nl, c.latronico@uva.nl, svanginhoven@getty.edu, v.carrettazamborlini@uva.nl",Lightning

We demonstrate how automatic information extraction of civil and trade registries can corroborate and validate information found in these sources, using duplicate information from the sources themselves as well as other published corpora that contain overlapping information. We present a technique that greatly reduces the need for manual revision of the data. Such a technique is dearly necessary - often research projects resort to hiring people to manually go through all the data or resort to crowdsourcing, which is expensive, slow, and has the problem that the data has to be looked at by multiple non-experts in order to find ‘likely correct’ data (see e.g. Zheng et al. 2017). Previous efforts to do such a thing have focused on cleaning OCR results by using contextual probabilities or word frequency probabilities (e.g. Reynaert 2014; Mei et al. 2018; Jatowt and Nguyen 2018; Doush, Alkhateeb and Gharaibeh 2018), at times combined with semantic data (e.g. Woodfield et al 2018), which works on texts that are representative of written vocabulary but is not very apt for lists of names and places. Our technique combines and compares several archival sources that include similar information on, for instance, person and place names. Thereafter, a probability estimation disambiguates between one or multiple occurences of references to what is most likely the same entity. To keep track of and to document this process we model and publish the data in the new roar ontology, which allows us to model archival data, while keeping the provenance chain of decision making and entity disambiguation. Informed by recent developments in the field of digital history as well as sociological literature on urban nightlife, this paper applies these techniques to address the underrepresentation of small, short-lived, and informal cultural venues in quantitative studies on cultural life. Even though the nineteenth and twentieth century witnessed the rise of nightlife industries as we know them today (Baldwin 2012; Schlör 1998; Nasaw 1999, Erenberg 1981), the organization of small entertainment venues and their effects on the production and consumption of urban cultural life have received little systematic analysis beyond case studies on individuals and single venues, especially in the Dutch context. This is partly due to the large number of yet undigitized archival periodicals such as address books, almanacs and program listings. However, the advent of new methods for digitizing and analyzing documents allowed us to develop a new and less labour intensive technique for uncovering and structuring these valuable sources. Figure 1 - Address book example (1824). Usual structure is: [name] [(initials/prefix)] [street name] [house number] [occupation] [either telephone number or neighbourhood number]. In this paper we help to redress this issue of underrepresentation by using automatic information extraction and entity disambiguation to systematically trace and analyse the spatial and diachronic distribution of clubs, restaurants and bars in relation to more formal cultural venues such as theatres and concert halls, as well as the rise of new entertainment venues such as cinemas. To reconstruct this urban pleasurescape, we contrast established historiographical narratives with a diverse set of historical sources. We reconstruct the public sphere of food and drink consumption by digitizing address books, the ‘yellow pages’ of those times (see Figure 1 for an excerpt of such a book), that listed most businesses in Amsterdam, their locations, and proprietors’ names. The data in the address books is semi-structured and rather consistent over time, whereby it was possible to programmatically extract information. We extracted all persons that had occupations in the food and drink service industry such as ‘koffijhuishouders’ [coffee shop holders] and ‘tappers’ [tavern keepers], but also theatres, cinemas and music venues. Once digitized, an automated comparison of these books significantly reduces the need for manual correction of OCR errors, spelling variation, other artifacts and errors. Other sources, such as the Amsterdam Citizen Registry, are used to validate the automatic extraction from the address books. We validate the method by gathering as many sources with overlapping information as possible, normalizing its contents slightly (e.g. orthography of occupations and street names) and scoring each bit of information to deduce which data is likely correct and which is not by taking into account source reliability, temporal and geographic distance, and number of sources giving the same and dissenting information. This also provides an order of probability of necessity of manual revision that makes it possible to address the problems in an efficient manner; the data is most quickly improved correcting the certainly wrong information first, and leaving the possibly wrong for later. For address books of subsequent years alone, the match rate is around 50%, which means that half the data does not need checking. For larger gaps between subsequent address books the match rate drops, since the information in the books differs increasingly over time. Adding a second address book from the year preceding the earliest increases the number to 60%. After linking the street names in the books with georeferenced data on Adamlink, we could plot their locations and see the changing patterns over time, demonstrating how patterns of urban expansion impacted on the organisation of urban nightlife in the city of Amsterdam between 1820 and 1940. Finally we fit and publish the data in the roar model, thereby creating transparent linked data reconstructions of historic persona and businesses for others to use. This systematic digital historical approach has, moreover, the added value of making source bias explicit, as the comparisons show which information present in one is not present in another. The bottom-up approach reveals significant gaps in our current knowledge of urban nightlife. It also shows the value of using multiple sources that overlap in the information they carry in reducing labour and increasing accuracy, and introduces roar as data model for storing this type of information.","l.vanwissen@uva.nl, c.rasterhoff@uva.nl, t.vanoort@uva.nl, i.kisjes@uva.nl",Long Presentation

These processes modify documents’ content, artifactual form, and structure, which subsequently influences the ways in which they are read, explored, and interpreted. Transparency of such processes ensures proper attribution of curators’ labor, promotes greater inclusiveness, and enables a more holistic and critical interpretation of historical records. But how to engage with and make visible these transformation processes? In this paper, we begin to address this question through a visualization case study based on an exemplary collection of biographical student records from the University of St Andrews (Scotland) that date back to the 18th century. We present – illustrated through this case study - a methodology based on visual (re)-interpretations of historical records over time which, we believe, is relevant to a wide range of information collections within and beyond humanities research.Biographical Student RecordsThe handwritten student records (1747-1897) collected by the University of St Andrews originally included students’ name, age, church affiliation and birthplace (Fig. 1.1), but over the course of two centuries, they have undergone a variety of transformations (Fig. 1). From 1888 to 1905 the records were transcribed by the University archivist, James Maitland-Anderson (Maitland Anderson, 1905; Fig. 1.2). Between 1960 and 2004, one of Maitland-Anderson’s successors, Dr Robert Smart, revised these transcriptions and expanded the records with students’ parental lineage, courses taken, and floruit, drawing from a large variety of sources (Smart, 2004; Fig. 1.3). From 2013 to 2016, a team around Dr Alice Crawford from the University library transformed Smart’s work into machine-readable form using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) (Fig. 1.4) which resulted in a web interface that allows targeted searches. In 2017, we transformed the data from Crawford’s work into a relational database which enabled the visualization of the records’ content (Vancisin et al., 2018; Fig. 1.5). To better understand the nature and impact of such modifications, we conducted interviews with the archivists, historians, and software engineers who have worked on these transformations. In combination with researching previous work on the records (Maitland Anderson, 1905; Smart, 2004), these interviews helped us identify and characterize four key transformations the records have undergone.{Figure 1: Records' Transformations.}Transcription. Maitland-Anderson and Smart transcribed the original handwritten documents into print form. This process required expertise in paleography and entailed interpretations, for example, of name spellings (e.g., Maitland-Anderson preserved the Latin ‘Petrus’ Dow; while Smart changed it to ‘Peter’; Fig. 1.1-1.3).Expansion. The records have been expanded by adding information from other archives (Smart), linking records to students’ publications (Crawford), and geo-encoding location mentions(Vancisin). These expansions can be considered as interpretations, informed by third-party sources.Re-Structuring. Maitland-Anderson deliberately preserved the structure of the original records, while Smart transformed them into an alphabetical index, enabling searches by-name but irrevocably removing the records’ temporal order. Crawford’s tagging imposed a rigid content structure on each record. Our database reconfigures and stores key information (dates, places etc.) in separate but linked tables. This re-structuring allowed new ways of representing and exploring the records, but also introduced additional interpretation layers.Artifactual Form. Transforming the handwritten records into print enabled easy record parsing, while the structural transformations allowed for new visual and textual representations and interactions. However, the individual human imprint of the handwritten text is lost in these transformations and so are their materiality and visual aesthetics (Forlini et al., 2018). These transformation processes can be considered as re-interpretations of the original records that enable new ways of engagement and representation. However, the fact that the records’ transformations are typically invisible is problematic from an ethical (Correll, 2019) and research perspective, because how we represent information fundamentally shapes our interpretation and the questions we ask. Moreover, an unawareness of underlying transformations hampers the holistic interpretation of historical records.Visualization OpportunitiesHistorical document visualization mainly focuses on providing access to the content of the collection in its ‘final’ stage (i.e., Edelstein et al., 2017; Hinrichs et al., 2015; Hyvönen et al., 2017), and our previous work is no exception (Vancisin, 2018; Fig. 2). Work by Hullman & Diakopulos (2011), however, shifts attention to the importance of weaving information about data provenance into visualization. Wrisley (2018) has promoted the idea of Pre-Visualization which argues for visualization prefaces that provide such perspectives in textual form. Péoux & Houllier (2017) introduce a diagrammatic approach to disclose transformation processes. However, visualization-driven approaches that highlight transformation processes and introduce critical and ethical perspectives to the document collection, its metadata, and their visual representations (Correll, 2019, Dörk et al. 2013, D’Ignazio & Klein, 2016) are unexplored. We have started addressing this challenge by investigating how we can portray the records’ transformation stages through visualization. Our visualization case study shown in Figure 3 presents one example of how this can be achieved.{Figure 2: Visualization of the records' content. (1,2) students' birth places within and outside of the UK; (3) distributions of nationalities; (4) student numbers in different colleges over time.}The bar chart at the bottom represents the temporal distribution of students in the original records (Fig. 3.1) while sketchy strokes emphasize the original records’ handwritten form. Subsequent transcriptions are depicted in an equivalent bar chart where smooth strokes show the records’ transformation into print (Fig. 3.2). The next layer highlights the records’ transformation into alphabetical order (reflecting Smart’s work) and the content expansion (represented by the bars’ width; Fig. 3.3). Crawford’s work revoked the records’ temporal or alphabetical ordering, so they are depicted as individual squares without any spatial organization (Fig. 3.4; square size corresponds to the amount of information in the record). Our database is shown in a horizontal node-link diagram where rectangles and arcs represent tables and their links (Fig. 3.5). All visualization layers are interactive and interlinked. Hovering over an element in one layer brings up the corresponding records in the record list view (Fig. 3.6) and highlights these in the other visualization layers (Fig. 4, 5 & 6).Although based on the same data, this type of visualization fundamentally differs from previous approaches in that it enables an exploration of the student records through the lens of their historical context, and through the people involved in their curation and interpretation. Our work, thus, provides a new perspective on visualizing historical documents by illustrating how to allow for their exploration by also considering their history, rather than just their ‘final’ interpretation. Our visualization of qualitative curatorial changes has to be considered as yet another interpretation of the original records, but we see this approach as an opportunity to make transparent others’ and our own interpretations of such collections; it promotes awareness of both the dynamic and interpretative character of historical documents and their visualizations.Our work combines the categorization of curatorial changes applied to the collection with their visualization, to promote transparency of the (re)-interpretations of the collection over time. Based on this case study, we launch discussion of design principles for visualizations that can make curatorial processes visible, in order to facilitate critical debate that centrally considers key curations of a collection over time (including pre-digital and early digitization), rather than rely only on ‘final’ data and/or final visualizations which often hide underlying interpretations that led to their assembly.

The advent of large open-access digital corpora offers increasingly representative samples of imperial literary production, which I use to systematically study this phenomenon. In this paper, I algorithmically extract descriptions of historical events from a corpus consisting of historical, fictional, and dramatic texts dating from mid-Ming to high-Qing China (approximately 1500 to 1800). I track when imperial texts mention dates and people, extract when works are textuality intertwined, and measure information density. I couple this with large-scale bibliographic analysis based on public domain library catalog records and contemporary bibliographies to map the historical focus of late imperial writing.

CETEIcean’s key feature is the isomorphic transformation of TEI into HTML by registering TEI elements with the browser as Custom Elements. This is in contrast to the typical methods for presenting TEI on the web that use the XML stack (XSLT/XQuery) to convert TEI XML sources to simple HTML—in the process discarding much of the information in the sources. Loading a TEI document with CETEIcean makes all of its information content accessible to the browser: TEI Custom Elements can be styled and made interactive with CSS and JavaScript just like HTML. We will begin with a discussion to contextualize this approach within the “minimal computing” movement, particularly as pioneered by the GO:DH Minimal Computing Working Group. This approach fosters “reconnecting with our knowledge production” in order to think critically about the question “what do we need?” (Alex Gil 2015 https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/thoughts/2015/05/21/user-vs-learner/). Identifying the minimal technical stack for running a TEI project can help content creators to reach their goals quickly and effectively, even when there are constraints on the resources they can access or the computing environments they rely upon. Minimal computing principles argue that this can be an essential instrument in giving voice to underfunded and underrepresented groups.

The GeoNewsMiner (GNM) is an interactive tool that maps and visualizes geographical references in historical newspapers. As a use case, we analysed Italian immigrant newspapers published in the United States from 1898 to 1920, as collected in the corpus ChroniclItaly (Viola 2018). Immigrant newspapers form a rich source that adds a historical dimension to the study of both the migration of the past century and the migratory experiences of migrant communities (Viola and Verheul 2019). They for instance enable researchers to compare references to the homeland and the host land (Vellon 2010; Forlenza and Thomassen 2016), thus offering an indication of the way diasporic media negotiate processes of assimilation and ethnic identification (Park 1922; Rhodes 2010; Viola and Musolff 2019, Viola and Verheul 2019), a topic that bears great relevance in the global age of satellite dishes and internet connectivity (Dhoest et al. 2012; Hickerson and Gustafson 2016; Parks 2005; Matsaganis, Katz, and Ball-Rokeach 2011; Appadurai 2008). In order to offer new perspectives on the geographies of the past, we employed a state-of-the-art deep learning method to extract and disambiguate place names from historical newspapers. Deep learning outperforms the state-of-the-art of place name extraction and disambiguation based on static lists in gazetteers or ensembles of NER-tools (Canale, Lisena, and Troncy 2018; Won, Murrieta-Flores, and Martins 2018; Mariona Coll Ardanuy and Sporleder 2017; Maria Coll Ardanuy 2017, Yadav & Bethard 2019). The two major advantages lie in its potential for text enriching: 1) they may be based on the historical context of a historical corpus; 2) they are able to recognize toponyms in a dynamic way, for instance as as a geographical concept (Viola and Verheul 2020). For the development of the GNM, we the deep learning sequence tagging tool developed by Riedl and Padó (2018). The sequence tagging retrieved 1,369 unique locations which occurred 214,110 times throughout the whole corpus. Because each individual document is timestamped, it was possible to quantify the number of references to each location was at any given time within the timeframe of ChroniclItaly, that is 1898-1920. Afterwards, locations were geocoded by using the Google API which identifies a place as it is stored in the Google Places database and in Google Maps. The tagged version of ChroniclItaly is available as an open access resource (ChroniclItaly 2.0, Viola 2019). Finally, to visualise and explore the data, we developed the GNM App (Figure 1). Unique to this tool is the possibility to aggregate the data according to a wide range of parameters (time; newspaper’s title; least/most mentioned places; absolute or relative frequency; aggregation on national, regional or city level). It is also possible to overlay historical maps that show the borders of selected years (1880, 1914, 1920, 1994), and download and share the data/results (Figure 2). This offers users the possibility to analyse the results in an intuitive, interactive, and reproduceable way as well as providing great flexibility to researchers working in spatial humanities, particularly from a historical perspective. One potential application of GNM is for example the possibility to reconstruct the “geographical agenda” of historical newspapers by analysing the changing geographical bias of the press, an issue urgent to fields such as media studies, cultural history and international relations (McCombs 2014; Craine 2014; Reese and Lee 2012; Wanta, Golan, and Lee 2004; Gans 2004; Beaudoin and Thorson 2001; Ginneken 1998; Gitlin 2003). As a preliminary data exploration, for instance, the tool shows that references to geographical locations in both Italy and the United States stay remarkably stable over the period that includes the First World War. The full documentation of GNM is made available to the research community to facilitate transparency, reproducibility and replicability (Viola 2020).[4] The app has much to recommend particularly to humanities scholars who are more and more confronted with the challenge of exploring collections larger than before and in a digital format.","lorella.viola@uni.lu, j.verheul@uu.nl",Short Presentation

As witnesses of his work, 556 manuscripts are currently known. Together with the 15 relevant prints that have been published during Goethe’s lifetime, a newly constituted text and supplementary material have been published in a hybrid edition (Goethe 2019).The edition aims to provide insight into the genesis of the drama’s text. Yet, the order in which the individual manuscripts have been created as well as the dating of the acts of inscription are subject to more than 100 years of research and editorial activity. Most studies only deal with a handful of witnesses and provide either a relative chronology or a broad dating for them. The only attempts to aggregate individual statements in order to place all relevant objects in a chronological-stemmatic relation to date have been provided by Renate Fischer-Lamberg. Her stemmata for two acts of Faust II (Fischer-Lamberg 1955, 150–66) probably mark the practical limit of how much of this information can be gasped by human means alone.Basic graph modelIn order to facilitate algorithmic aggregation, the edition project has first formalized the assertions from the research literature as illustrated in fig. 1.Figure 1: Formalizing absolute datings and relative chronologies from literature, and including them in a common graph model (Vitt and Brüning 2019)Early attempts of working with the data used logic solvers and a set of rules to infer new, derived assertions (Wissenbach, Pravida, and Middell 2012). In the current approach, graph based models are used since they provide dual benefit: There is a wealth of algorithms to answer various questions on graphs, and subgraphs can be easily visualized in order to understand and justify a certain witness’s dating.The basic model combines all formalized assertions into a single directed multi-graph as illustrated in fig. 1. Under the assumptions that all assertions are correct, we can now infer an order that is consistent with all assertions (a topological sorting (Kahn 1962)), and we might be able to infer or improve limits for the absolute dating of a witness by looking for the nearest reachable dates in the graph.ConflictsUnfortunately, there are contradictions between some of the assertions. In the graph, contradictions appear as cycles and prevent both kinds of deduction outlined above. Since the data features a strongly connected component with 477 documents and 2136 edges inducing millions of cycles, it is not possible to determine manually which edges best to remove to make the graph acyclic. While this problem generally is NP-hard (Karp 1972), an algorithm by Baharev, Schichl, and Neumaier (2015) solves it for our graph, suggesting a relatively small subset of edges to remove (171 of 3480). Edge weights based on the assertions’ sources influence this algorithm.For each automatically determined conflict, a visualisation indicating conflicting assertions makes it easy to manually check against the original sources (fig. 2). The result can be fed back into the data by assigning edges a specificly large or low weight.Figure 2: Conflict visualization for an automatically discarded edge (dashed red)InscriptionsTo complicate things further, a single document may contain multiple inscriptions (Hoenen and Brüning 2019), i.e., it may have been written on in completely separate working phases. E.g., the single sheet 2 II H.5 (cf. fig. 2) has verses belonging to different parts of Faust on the recto and verso side, so Bohnenkamp (1994) deduced from what is known about Goethe’s working phases that they might have been written 25 years apart. (Brüning and Hahn (2017) show both sides are written with the same ink, indicating synchronicity instead).There are assertions both on inscriptions as well as on their respective witness as a whole (fig. 3), and it is not always clear or consistent between authors which parts of the text belong to which inscription.Figure 3: 2 II H.5 and its inscriptionsModel variantsThere have been experiments with variants on the model to deal with these differences:Copying information about inscriptions to their corresponding witnesses changed the ordering of 17 datable objects.Research literature provides a few assertions about “approximately synchronous” witnesses. To include this information, incoming and outgoing edges have been distributed within each group of synchronous witnesses. This induced absolute datings for more nodes, and it also changed the ordering for up to 67 objects.Witnesses and inscriptions were modelled using two linked nodes each, representing the start and end of the working phase. All incoming edges end at the start node, all outgoing edges emerge from the end node, and inscriptions are linked to their inscription in order to happen ‘during’ the timespan of the witness (fig. 4). This model decreased the conflicting edges (to 139), and it has some influence on the ordering.Figure 4: Working phase as intervalEvaluationThere is no pre-known correct ordering to use as a gold standard for evaluation. However, a few measurable values indicate a better model:Less conflicting edges reduce the workload for manual review.The number of nodes for which a not-before or not-after limit could be inferred hints at the usefulness of the model.Different orderings of the witnesses can be compared, e.g. by using a rank correlation like Spearman’s Rank Correlation based on the mean squared difference between the respective ranks of all nodes in two rankings.Further workFig. 4 models witnesses as intervals. This could be improved by modelling everything as intervals and allowing all 13 possible relations in between. Allen (1983) developed a graph model for this, but that does not provide conflict resolution out of the box.Vague absolute datings line “spring 1825” are normalized to standard crisp intervals. Research, e.g., by Holmen and Ore (2010) uses fuzzy sets to model fuzzy intervals, and Schockaert and De Cock (2008) define relations and inference on such fuzzy intervals. Whether this approach is tractable for our data still needs to be determined.",thorsten.vitt@uni-wuerzburg.de,Short Presentation

It seeks to make this Chinese classical writing more understandable for the younger generation, and meanwhile to provide a useful indexlike instrument for humanities researchers. The paper presents two steps of reconstructing SongYuan Xue’an. First, the text is converted into a knowledge graph by extracting named entities of scholars, places, dates and their inter-relationships, to build a graph database with Neo4j platform. Second, three visualization tools are used to demonstrate the genealogy of philosophy schools and relationships among them.Keyword visualization; Song-Yuan Xue’an; knowledge graph; Chinese classic literature. Song-Yuan Xue’an (Scholarly Annals of Song and Yuan Dynasties) is a historical account of philosophers and their doctrines in Song and Yuan Dynasties of ancient China. It consists of nearly one hundred scholar cases, each of which records the biographies and academic contributions of a prominent scholar and his disciples.Nowadays, it is difficult for the younger generation to understand complicated and large-volume Chinese classical writings through word-by-word reading. Meanwhile, modern researchers in humanities also need a knowledge-based visualization tool which can provide an overview of classic materials and help them formulate research questions. Therefor, to make traditional literature more accessible and understandable to both digital natives and humanities researchers, an interactive web-based system, with intuitive visualization functions and assisting tools for background knowledge, is necessary.In fact, there are several research projects focusing on how to present historical and literary materials. Zhou et al. analyzed Tang poems and visualized the citation networks among poets (Zhou et al. 2019). Chen et al. built a linked data platform of Chinese Biographical Database and demonstrated the relations between people as a linked graph (Chen et al. 2019). Forlini et al. visualized the Bob Gibson collection of speculative fiction with radial tree graph organized by themes of the fictions(Forlini et al. 2016). Lee et al. analyzed the social networks in Shakespeare’s works with diagram(Lee and Lee 2017). Eve created an interactive game to help readers explore the Bible text(Eve 2007).This paper introduces our work of reconstructing the Song-Yuan Xue’an into a knowledge graph upon which several visualization tools are designed for distant reading. To make the classical literature of 300 years ago more comprehensible to history novices, a historical chronology, an ancient bureaucratic hierarchy, and an administrative map of the Song Dynasty are imbedded to provides the temporal, official, and spatial background knowledge respectively for close reading. First of all, we convert the text of the Song-Yuan Xue’an into a knowledge graph with two steps. In the first step, the scholars’ profiles, spatial-temporal data, and semantic relationships among them are recognized and extracted with regular expressions according to the structure of the text. Then, all the extracted entities are encoded into RDF triples according to the identified semantic relationships, and then stored into the Neo4j graph database.We then implement three kinds of visualization tools to demonstrate the development and genealogy of the philosophy schools mentioned in the book. The first one is a streamgraph, representing the varying trend of scholar numbers over the time span of the Song and Yuan Dynasties. The second is a sankey diagram, illustrating the lineage relationships between a Neo-Confucianism school and those derived from it. The third is a pie chart where the center represents a specific scholar and three colored slices represent three group of people related to him: his tutors, disciples and colleagues respectively. All of these visualization tools are interactive, and users can traverse iteratively and explore the underneath knowledge graph. We implement four functions to assist in reading this comprehensive classical work: general search, distant reading, close reading, and semantic search. The general search functions like a search engine. The distant reading function contains three diagrams that provide an overview of SongYuan Xue’an. As mentioned above, the streamgraph demonstrates the evolution trend of the NeoConfucian schools over 400 years; and the sankey graph, together with a genealogy tree diagram, shows their origination and influences among each other. The interactive pie chart illustrates the persons related to a particular scholar. The close reading section re-organizes the original text with the semantic relationships extracted from the book, thus related entities of various types are aggregated on the subject that readers are paying attention to. For example, when a person is selected, the places he visited, the book titles he wrote and the official positions he ever took are retrieved from the knowledge graph automatically and displayed alongside his biology. The readers can invoke the embedded historical chronology, the official hierarchy, and the administrative map of Song Dynasty anytime when he has difficulties in understanding. The semantic search section provides a user-friendly interface to construct complicated semantic queries step by step to search exhaustively in the graph database. How to make classic literature more accessible and understandable for both Internet generation and professional researchers is an important question in the pedagogy of the humanities. This project utilizes the knowledge graph and visualization techniques to reconstruct the classic work and make it comprehensible to touch-screen users, demonstrating the value of visualizations in digital humanities fields as a concordance-like tool for classics. The knowledge nodes, including persons, places, time periods, book titles, official titles are extracted from text and represented in RDF triples.

Reflecting on results of a data-driven analysis of Mediabase’s country airplay reports from 2000 to 2018, this paper considers the role of data in the process of shaping country music culture, and reframes our understanding of these reports as an instrument that systematically “remembers” some artists, while “casting away” or “forgetting” others. Over the course of this period, the number of songs by women played on country format radio declined 41.3% (Fig. 1). These reports map the evolving terrain of country music’s cultural space and have resulted in a system that pushes women to the margins: songs by women are played infrequently on country format radio (Fig. 2), with the majority of their airplay occurring in the overnights (Fig. 3) (Watson 2019a/b). As a result, songs by women are charting in declining numbers, peaking in the bottom positions of the weekly charts, and barely heard in radio’s peak daytime hours. Such practices impact black women more significantly (Watson 2020). In this way, the reports reveal a digital redlining of women, wherein programming practices are perpetuating inequalities by refusing high traffic times of day to already marginalized artists. More critically, this paper addresses the challenges of critiquing social remembering through public scholarship and reflects (as Marcia Chatelain [2016] does in her work) on my experiences of thinking and working in public digital spaces.Gender has been a central dynamic of country music history and culture (Pecknold & McCusker 2016), wherein masculinity and femininity are invoked to define class boundaries, cultural tastes, institutional hierarchies, performance styles, and the evolution socially prescribed roles. With strong ties to conservatism and religion, country’s first female artists often appeared on stage with their husband or male family members, a constant reassurance for record-buyers that the social order in which females performed familial roles and habits of constancy and tradition endured in the genre (McCusker 2017). Following WWII, as female artists began taking a more prominent role on stage and behind the scenes, cultural institutions actively sought to censor lyrics in women’s songs if they were too “suggestive”, aggressive, or politically charged—a trend that has continued throughout the genre’s history (Bufwack & Oermann 2004; Keel 2004; Watson & Burns 2010). Behind the scenes, the country music industry has employed a strict quota system for female artists on radio playlists and label rosters (Penuell 2015), which has, in turn, limited their opportunities for participating within the mainstream of the industry as performer and songwriters.Adopting methods for data-driven studies of popular music charts (Wells 2001; Lafrance et al 2011) and influenced by the concept of prosopography (Keats-Rohan 2007; Crompton & Schwartz 2018), this project has developed an approach for collecting and organizing music industry data in order to study how the biography of individuals shapes and is shaped by the genre’s cultural constructs. In order to address complex socio-cultural issues of equity and diversity in country music, it has developed a comprehensive dataset of all of the singles played on country format radio between 2000 and 2018, enhanced with biographic information about the lead and featured artists involved in performing the recorded tracks played on country radio to facilitate a vast range of queries about programming practices and their impact on weekly charts. In so doing, this project deconstructs the gender politics that have governed the genre and shows how big data has created and perpetuated gender inequalities and contributed to the continued marginalization and “forgetting” of female narrative voices within country music culture.  Figure 1.

Jingzhu Wei, School of Information Management, Sun Yat-sen University Allen H Renear, School of Information Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-ChampaignIntroductionThere has been a long conversation about method in the humanities and social sciences (Vico, Weber, Dilthey, Gadamer, and Winch, for example). Within the DH community this conversation takes a distinctive form amidst the interweaving of traditional humanistic approaches with the more empirical scientific methods associated with our new tools and research strategies[1,2,4,10]. Conceptual analysis can help support this interweaving by contributing to the forms available for the needed interpretive thickening of research in the digital humanities.Thick description and conceptual analysisClifford Geertz makes a distinction, now classic in interpretative social science, between “thin” and “thick” description[6], terms first used by Gilbert Ryle, who offers this example: a thin description would describe a composer as producing note sequences, but a thick description interprets the same phenomena as “cancellings, modifyings, assemblings, reassemblings, rehearsings” — that is, the composer’s thoughts and intentions situated within a particular cultural context[12].Conceptual analysis clarifies a concept by formally identifying conditions individually necessary and collectively sufficient for its occurrence. Although central to analytic philosophy, in the last several decades conceptual analysis has also been used to complement empirical methods in the social and cultural sciences, and, more recently, in the information sciences[3,5,8,9,14,16].For cultural phenomena the requirements identified by conceptual analysis can help provide opportunities for thickening descriptions. We illustrate this with the concept of (intellectual) influence.Influence in the humanities, and in the digital humanitiesMuch research in the humanities explores influence — how the literary, religious, or scientific beliefs, attitudes, tastes, or feelings of a person or group of persons influenced others, often focusing on artifacts or events considered as evidence for influence, instruments of influence, or the primary agents and patients.In the digital humanities our projects explore influence by putting data in digital form and analyzing that data with computational methods[15].   We detect stylistic similarities, transmitted corrections and errors, related themes and topics, and so on. We then advance claims or hypotheses that assert or explain the influences we have evidence for.Although understanding influence is a common research objective there has been little effort to define the concept itself. We routinely indicate what we count as evidence of influence, but rarely say, clearly and exactly, what we mean by the term — such omissions will become increasingly problematic in the future as research in the digital humanities, and in fact the humanities in general, is likely to be focusing on larger and larger quantities of thinner and thinner data.  Motivation for conceptual clarification: Causation is not InfluenceWe are often told that correlation is not causation — but neither is causation influence, and thinning data and methods are conducive to the latter fallacy as well. We might say a person X influenced a person Y because X’s views had a causal effect on Y’s views. Suppose however that a novelist’s views on class lead to a successful potboiler and the proceeds are anonymously donated to a political theorist — who then has time to develop a particular analysis of class. This is causation to be sure, and a quick inference from a thin description might classify it as influence, but it is not influence — influence is causation of a certain sort.The example may seem cooked up, but it makes the point. The well-known problem of “deviant causal chains”[11] is a challenge both to empirical methods, which must extract influence from causation, and to analytical efforts which attempt to identify a basis for that distinction. These are related issues. Preventing the conflation of causation and influence in a world of thin data, requires a deeper conceptual understanding of influence.Steps towards a conceptual analysis of influenceWe first adapt Grice’s account of intended meaning[7]:S states that P if and only if    S utters U intending thatSomeone, x, forms the belief that Px recognizes that S intends 1)x forms the belief that P at least partially because 2)Grice establishes that neither 1) alone, nor 1) and 2) together are sufficient for an occurrence of some particular linguistic behavior meaning P, and although some problems remain the three clauses together to appear to be a reasonable first characterization. We therefore begin our account of influence by building on Grice:H is influenced by S =dfS states that PH forms the belief that P  and does so at least partially because H recognizes that S stated that PSuch a limited notion of influence may seem of little interest and we make no claims for direct applicability. A complete and robust account of influence would consider influences from/on sensibility, taste, and other affective a states, as well as capabilities, skills, propagated or transitive influence, and more; it would also include the influence of communicative objects and non-linguistic events.Nevertheless, these analyses establishes much: the need for intention, the need for reflexive intention (intentions about intentions), and, in particular, for an intention that recognition of intention be a partial cause of the response. Such features can help guide the construction of thick interpretive description from thin digital data.Deviant Causal Chains: Resolved and RestoredAnother achievement of this analysis is the elimination of a class of deviant causal chain counterexamples. In the case described above the political theorist’s views will fail our requirement that they be at least partially caused by the recognition of the novelist’s views, and so will not be counted as influence.Unfortunately another subset of cause/influence conflating counterexamples remains: suppose the novelist communicates his views on class to the political theorist, who then herself writes and publishes the potboiler (based on those views) that funds her research. The recognition condition is met, but the theorist’s research has not been (intellectually) influenced by the views of the novelist.Interpretation AbidesEliminating deviant causal chains counterexamples has proven difficult in other analyses of fundamental social and cultural concepts, and may be impossible. But this does not undermine the practical usefulness of conceptual analysis — rather it reminds us of the limitations of formal strategies, and the fluid nature of conceptual understanding. It is significant that we rarely have any trouble with cases: once we understand the case we recognize immediately whether the causal chain is deviant or legitimizing. Conceptual analysis can help guide thick description in the digital humanities, but it is not a replacement for interpretation.","414705062@qq.com, renear@illinois.edu",Long Presentation

By using large quantities of research data and various tools to process and analyse these data, Digital Humanities scholars can address questions that were previously considered too complicated or time-consuming to answer. But the development of the DH field has also reshaped the needs of researchers. DH scholars desire increasingly larger, sufficiently annotated sets of research data and advanced tools to process them. This abstract introduces a number of services offered by CLARIN, the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure, that are particularly interesting for the DH community.As a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) established by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI), CLARIN is a non-commercial Research Infrastructure providing single sign-on access to natural language resources and tools free of charge for all academic researchers. Countries or regions can join CLARIN as member, observer, or third party. As of June 2020, the CLARIN consortium consists of 21 full members, three observers, and a third party, covering a total of 25 participating countries (figure 1). Within each national consortium a number of institutes (universities, academies, research institutes, museums, archives, etc.) contribute resources, tools, and knowledge to the CLARIN infrastructure. Figure 1: This map shows countries and regions participating in CLARIN as member, observer, or third party, and various types of CLARIN centres.CLARIN aims to cater the needs of the entire DH community. Clearly, these needs differ widely. Some DH researchers, for example, like to collect, curate, and deposit their own data sets and to develop their own tools, while others prefer to focus on solving a piece of the puzzle of the various aspects of human society and culture, leaving the technical development to others. Surely, there is no such thing a one-size-fits-all solution to cater to the needs of all different types of DH researchers. However, a number of developments would benefit the DH community at large. For instance, making resources and tools as sustainable, openly available, interoperable, and easily findable as possible. From the outset, it has been CLARIN’s strategy to make its resources and tools available according to the later defined FAIR data principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. CLARIN is a distributed infrastructure. Researchers can deposit their resources in one of the certified CLARIN centres offering open repositories, each devoted to a specific research field. The metadata of each deposit gets automatically harvested by the Virtual Language Observatory (VLO, https://vlo.clarin.eu/), a faceted search engine allowing everyone to find resources deposited in all of the CLARIN repositories. Currently, the VLO gives access to over 900,000 records. Once a relevant resource has been found it can be immediately processed by a number of analytical tools for part-of-speech tagging, distant reading, topic modelling, named entity recognition, machine translation, and various other tasks using the CLARIN Language Resource Switchboard (http://switchboard.clarin.eu/). The Switchboard takes into account features like modality, format, and language to match resources to tools. In addition to a full inventory of all resources made available through the various CLARIN repositories, CLARIN also provides user-friendly overviews of key resources. These overviews of CLARIN Resource Families (https://www.clarin.eu/resource-families) provide information on the availability, language, size, annotation, and license of the resources. Currently, ten corpora families, five families of lexical resources, and three tool families are offered. The corpora families include parliamentary corpora, newspaper corpora, literary corpora, spoken corpora, and computer-mediated communication corpora (e.g. social media posts). The overviews are initiated based on the input of domain experts across the world and continue to be manually curated. But CLARIN offers more than just data and tools. Knowledge is a key component of the CLARIN infrastructure. A coordinated system of Knowledge centres provides knowledge and expertise to researchers. Each Knowledge centre has its own specific area of expertise, such as data management, language learning analysis, speech analysis, treebanking, and several languages. Several funding instruments allow researchers, teachers, and developers to collaborate and to teach each other, stimulating cross-country and cross-disciplinary collaboration. Dozens of recorded presentations, tutorials, discussions, and other videos have been made available on VideoLectures.NET (http://videolectures.net/clarin/).Researchers, teachers, developers, citizen-scientists, policy makers, politicians, journalists, and other people interested in getting to know more about CLARIN are invited to have a look at the CLARIN Value Proposition (https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition). Those who would like to know what is going on in their national CLARIN consortium can have a look at the list of participating consortia (https://www.clarin.eu/content/participating-consortia) or at the Tour de CLARIN webpage (https://www.clarin.eu/Tour-de-CLARIN), an ongoing initiative to highlight the activities in national consortia and Knowledge centres.",l.c.wessels@uu.nl,Lightning

From large-scale accounts on collective developments (such as cultural histories, art-historical movements, or socio-technical translation processes) to individual biographies of actors and objects - datafication initiatives frequently utilize event-based data formats to model complex topics as constellations of historical data points. Aside from time stamps, these data points then often are defined by further attributes, which provide their geographic, categorical, or relational specifics. The availability of such complex datasets opens new opportunities for DH research and teaching, but also for the public communication of humanities topics, and for open science endeavors.However, when engaging in the visual analysis and communication of complex historical data, scholarly or public audiences rarely get to see their multidimensional richness. Commonly, visualization tools require analysts to selectively ‘cut’ into the complexity of the data to highlight and project particular aspects, while neglecting other facets and data dimensions. While coordinated multiple views allow us to establish plurality of perspectives side by side (Dörk et al., 2018; Roberts et al., 2019), they come with a variety of downsides on their own, including the splitting of users’ attention, and a significant amount of visual complexity (Baldonado et al., 2000; Windhager et al., 2018a). Figuratively speaking, multiple views allow us to grasp, see, and sample vital parts of the proverbial elephant, while hindering us to see the whole, dynamic organism in its particular context. If we want to overcome this state of affairs, we have to (re)connect and (re)assemble the partial impressions from multiple views for ourselves, which turns out to be a demanding cognitive task (Windhager et al., 2018a).To provide a more integrated approach to the analysis of event-based data, we introduce the PolyCube visualization framework. As a web-based visualization system, it draws together multiple perspectives to convey a bigger picture for complex, time-oriented data, and to support synoptic exploration of the data, as well as navigation between specific perspectives for expert and casual users alike. The system provides:multiple spatialized (i.e. geographic and non-geographic) overview perspectives (including a map-based, a set-based, and a network-based view),multiple perspectives on the temporal data dimension (including space-time cuberepresentation, juxtaposition, animation and superimposition views)close-up access to single events or objects on demand, together withanimated canvas transitions, supporting the switching between various views.To demonstrate the analytical options of this system, we turn to the field of cultural heritage studies, and showcase the visual analysis of two cultural heritage collections (Windhager et al., 2020), including the Charles W.

How to enact more open, public work is not always obvious, however. Researchers often face barriers to engaging in open and public-facing scholarship, including lack of training, infrastructure, and technical and community support. The Open Knowledge Program at the University of Victoria’s Electronic Textual Cultures Lab (ETCL) facilitates intersections between the scholarly and public communities by supporting university and community researchers in creating open knowledge: “what open data becomes when it’s useful, usable and used” (Open Knowledge Foundation n.d.). In this paper, we discuss the trajectory of the program so far, share examples of participants’ contributions, and invite feedback and discussion about adapting the program for other contexts and its next steps.The ProgramThe Open Knowledge Program is based in the ETCL, a collaborative humanities research lab with a focus on open scholarship and a mandate that includes research, training, and service.The Program comprises three initiatives: the Open Knowledge Practicum (OKP), the Open Knowledge Practicum at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (OKP@DHSI), and the Open Knowledge Residency (OKR). The OKP is a term-long program that welcomes researchers from UVic and the wider community into the lab to work on an open knowledge project, including contributing to Wikipedia. The OKP@DHSI supports the ETCL’s global community by inviting DHSI students and instructors into the lab for a condensed, three-day version of the OKP. The OKR offers graduate students in any discipline at UVic an intensive, week-long residency in the lab to conduct thesis or doctoral research and share findings in an open venue.The InterventionJust as digital scholarship has moved from the periphery of the Humanities towards its centre, open scholarship is increasingly recognized as the new scholarly mode. This transition from closed to open is driven partly by necessity — the costs of the current subscription model of scholarly communication being unsustainable for many research libraries — and partly by researchers driven to engage with the broader community and universities striving to fulfill their public missions (CARL–ABRC 2010; O’Gara 2019; Suber 2019). It is also driven by opportunity, since digital technologies have made it possible to share scholarly work widely with academic and public readers, greatly extending its “reach” (Maxwell 2015, 2).Digital tools allow researchers to engage with new types of research materials, new tools and methodologies, and new modes of communication, but require skills that are not part of traditional Humanities curricula, including collaboration. These digital skills are increasingly recognized as essential for scholarly work and beyond, particularly for emerging scholars (Brier 2012; El Khatib, Arbuckle, and Siemens 2019; IPLAI 2013; Jakacki and Faull 2016; Lewis et al. 2015; MLA 2014; NEH 2016; Reid 2012). The Open Knowledge Practicum draws on the pedagogical model of the practicum, in which skills and knowledge are applied in practice. Practicums are common in Education and professional fields including nursing and clinical psychology, but much less so in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Although practicums are usually part of a larger curriculum, the OKP employs this model as a standalone program, in which researchers plan, develop, and create their own research projects. In doing so, participants put their subject matter expertise and digital skills into action by creating open knowledge resources while gaining experience working in a DH lab as part of a research team. Participants develop their own projects in consultation with the lab team and our colleagues in the Library and across campus as needed. The lab team also provides just-in-time collaborative learning as needed in the use of specific software applications, digital tools, and project management. Honorariums for participants comprise registration in a DHSI course, providing further opportunity for learning, putting learning into practice, and building community.In its focus on open scholarship as praxis, the Open Knowledge Program complements the “apprenticeship model that dominates graduate training and socialization in the humanities and elsewhere across the university,” which focuses tightly on skills necessary to institutional frameworks (Bartha and Burgett 2015, 33­–4). These frameworks, however, leave little space for digital and public scholarship: review, promotion, and tenure guidelines, for example, tend to discourage open scholarship in favour of more traditional forms of scholarly communication (Alperin et al. 2018). In their study of best practices for supporting digital scholarship, Lewis, Spiro, Wang, and Cawthorne note that physical space in which to work, collaborate, and learn is key (2015, 2). Lewis et al. also find that “collaborative competencies” and “learning mindsets,” comprising “creativity, curiosity, and an enthusiasm for learning” are as important for digital scholarly work as technical skills (2015, 2). Building regular lab hours into the Program’s structure provides participants with a shared physical workspace as well as a highly collaborative community of practice that facilitates social knowledge creation (Burke 2000). Participants in the Program determine the subject and scope of their project, pursuing interests that intersect with their academic work or study, or not. In this way, the Program creates intellectual space and scheduled time for curiosity, exploration, and creativity, space that is often difficult to find within a university’s institutional structure (Bartha and Burgett 2015). Many projects focus on social justice issues such as wealth inequality, Indigenous knowledge systems, international LGBTQ rights, and histories of oppressed groups (ETCL 2020; El Khatib et al. 2019). The Open Knowledge Program has evolved over the past few years to support standalone projects as well as multi-term endeavours and components of large, grant-funded research initiatives with faculty partners and their student research assistants. We anticipate that describing the structure and goals of the Open Knowledge Program and highlighting the work of its participants will open a discussion of the Program’s future directions and provide a model for other digital scholarship centres that are invested in public scholarship and open knowledge production.","winterc@uvic.ca, khatib@uvic.ca, alyssaa@uvic.ca, siemens@uvic.ca",Long Presentation

Instead of using what Liu names as rhetoric-representation-interpretation to convey an understanding of history, we are now stuck in an ambiguous regime of communication-information-media where it is not clear how we reach an understanding of anything (2-3). The shift from rhetoric-representation-interpretation to communication-information-media is not unique in the history of literary studies, however. It follows another shift that occurred over 100 years ago in how rhetoric was deployed. Gérard Genette observed in 1966 that literary studies had not always emphasized representations. Before the end of the nineteenth century, literary studies revolved around the art of writing. Texts were not objects to interpret but models to imitate: students demonstrated their understanding of literature by mastering elocution and reproducing figures of style in the works they read. With the institution of literary history as a nationalist project at the end of the nineteenth century, academic reading approached texts as objects to be explained according to prescribed methods for documenting how literature represented a national identity. This new way of studying literature stressed disposition, or the arrangement of ideas in the service of ideology.The methods of literary history would eventually be used by literary scholars in the twentieth century to turn narratives about literature away from nationalism toward other priorities, most notably poststructuralism and the critique of cultural hegemonies.Recent developments in information technology have further challenged paradigms for reading literature. Digital tools for text analysis allow for the study of large corpora using quantitative methods. As Ted Underwood, Andrew Piper and others have shown, large-scale computational text analysis has called into question fundamental concepts in literary history such as periodization, nationality, and genre. Using computational methods can enable us to develop models for literary studies, but these models are not limited to interpretation. Computational techniques such as topic modeling and word vector spaces can facilitate investigations into the possibilities for literary creation. Technology has the potential for exploring invention, or the finding of ideas to express through language given a context that can be parameterized.If, in literary studies, an emphasis on elocution or style served the perpetuation of social hierarchies, and if an emphasis on disposition or argumentation challenged these hierarchies by promoting forms of knowledge and ideologies, a new rhetorical emphasis is needed to respond to the ontological condition of the communication-information-media era. We are surrounded by data with no clear way to make sense of it, and we need to explore inventional methods of finding things to say within this state of being. Digital environments today constitute in part the material context for suasive activity, and as Thomas Rickert argues, contemporary rhetoric must attend to how humans and the world are in this context (xv). The affordances of networked access to texts and computational processing contribute to a rhetorical ambience that grants a degree of agency to the environment in what is said about the world, which includes literature.I will consider two examples of how tools for computational literary studies lend themselves to inventional practices. The first is ReRites, a year-long project by David (Jhave) Johnston who used a neural net trained on various corpora to produce poetry (“Why A.I.?”, 172). The raw text of the poetry was generated by computation but Johnston edited the output. In terms that emphasize the materiality of computation, Johnston describes his role as “carving the text.” Neither the computer nor Johnston writes these poems in the sense we usually give to writing: they emerge from the world in which a machine and a human find themselves. After performing complex analyses on very large corpora, the machine produces something the human takes to find something to say with language.The second is SonGenApp, a web application I developed that enables a user to select verses from a large corpus of sonnets to assemble a new poem. From all the verses in the corpus a word embedding is modeled with word2vec, and from the model the user selects verses semantically with an analogy based on a pair of words. The user can modify a selected verse as long as it follows the rules of scansion and rhyme for sonnets. With the application attending to formal constraints, the task of the user is to find verses that are meaningful in some way at the moment of using the application. The user can always read the source texts for selected verses and base the construction of the generated poem on a knowledge of literary themes and history. But this prior knowledge is not necessary. The user can encounter verses in the corpus by changing the analogy as if it were a knob on a black box.The quantity of digital texts at our disposal opens possibilities for discovery in rhetorical invention. Stephen Ramsay has described a “hermeneutics of screwing around” where browsing resources leads serendipitously to the pleasure of finding things one had not anticipated. Computation has the potential to afford the same discovery in finding things to express through writing.",wolff.mark.b@gmail.com,Lightning

Histories of European modern architecture examine a consistent core of these entities. From each of four English-language histories of European modern architecture (by Le Corbusier, Reyner Banham, Anthony Vidler, and Jean-Louis Cohen), we construct a graph of the objects, people, and texts mentioned in the same context. Different modeling resolutions can be used; we add undirected, unweighted edges between all nodes that occur on the same printed pages. We construct our graphs at the page-level because the data comes from book indices. In actor-network theory, which is popular in many fields including architectural history, as in our work, both humans and cultural artifacts can be network constituents. Networks have been used in other digital art history, for example in social analysis and mapping projects. To our knowledge, ours is the first work on architectural history that explicitly constructs networks from texts and quantifies aspects of them.These four graphs provide overlapping but distinct views of modern architecture spaced throughout the last century. Network analysis, in the form of eigenvector centrality and triangle counting, allows us to make observations about both the form and content of these histories. This process allows comparisons between how the different histories relate groups of objects, and we find that some of the texts reexamine objects in multiple contexts much more frequently. Our results compare and contrast how the works construct historical importance, which is determined through close readings of the histories in question and supplemented by other histories of modern architecture. We quantify the importance of different people, objects, and texts in each of the networks, providing an empirical comparison between stated notions of historical importance and importance derived from the structures of the texts. Network analysis provides additional evidence to augment rather than supplant traditional ideas of historical importance.We find that certain architects that the histories portray as important, like Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, are in fact the most central in the four graphs. In the later histories, we find that modern architects are more often mentioned with the work they influenced rather than with the works to which they understood themselves to be responding. For example, Le Corbusier wrote about his response to Greek architecture, while the later histories focus on his relation to buildings other architects designed during his early career. Methodologies for comparing networks derived from multiple texts are used to investigate architectural history in this case study, but they are also useful for any situation with multiple views of relationships between similar entities. We expect the methodology to afford larger historiographical studies in other areas of architecture and history.","gjy24@cornell.edu, mimno@cornell.edu",Poster

This project falls under Alison Booth's paradigm of ""mid-range reading"" because it sacrifices both the granular details of close reading and the massive scalability of distant algorithms. The payoff, however, is a versatile methodology through which digital research is consciously co-constructed with a mechanical collaborator.My test case is Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's Empire.

However, the OCR for historical documents is challenging, especially for the handwritten or printed ones without a training dataset, in which each character has hundreds or thousands of labeled examples. We focus on the recognition of the following types of primary sources for studying Chinese history, including handwritten Tangut historical documents, stele texts written in ancient Chinese, and place names on Chinese historical maps, as shown in Figure 1.Figure 1. Tangut Historical Documents, Steles with Ancient Chinese Characters and Historical MapsTangut, invented and used by the West Xia State in Chinese history, has distinguished for more than 1000 years. The main Tangut documents were found and evacuated from Khara-Khoto by P. K. Kozlov in the early 20th century, which are important primary sources complementing to the Chinese historical documents for studying that period of Chinese history. A large collection of steles with texts in ancient Chinese keeps important information of the time it was built, which needs to be digitized for history study. Historical maps are different from the first two types because they contain texts (place names) as well as images. The positions of place names on the map are random and the directions of the place names vary. Though the three tasks are different, we propose a unified workflow and framework for recognizing texts in these historical documents.Our workflow has four phases: (1) text detection and segmentation, (2) character annotation, (3) model training, and (4) text line recognition. The core function of the workflow is deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). The multiply stacked convolutional layers are used in all the four phases of the workflow. They extract features that can be used in the character classification (phase 4) and text line detection (phase 1) as well as in the generation of supported characters for rare characters (phase 2). For the character classification and generation, a fully connected layer is added at the end of the stacked convolutional layers to output the predicted class for a given input image. For the text line detection, the fully connected layer is removed and a fully convolutional network (FCN) is attached to do pixel-level segmentation.  Text line detection and segmentation is a part of document layout analysis, where FCN [1]and U-Net[2][3] are usually used. We use a modified U-Net to detect text lines in the Chinese historical documents and then segment them from the document images. The characters in the lines are annotated manually when we had not enough labeled single characters at first. We have developed a method to generate support examples for representing rarely used characters, Target-Directed Mixup for labeling characters[4]. When most characters have enough examples, we can synthesize a large number of text lines using the labeled characters to form the training dataset for the text line recognition. We train a model for recognizing the segmented lines by combining a convolutional neural network and a recurrent neural network based on the synthesized text lines with CTC[5] as the loss function. For the historical maps, the detected regions with places names are segmented and restored into normal orientation, and then they are fed into the trained model for recognition. The recognized text lines are shown in Figure 2 as an example, where human experts could correct the results.Figure 2. Segmentation and Recognition Result of a Page of Tangut DocumentsThe workflow has been successfully used in these three tasks. Although the framework is designed for recognizing ancient Chinese and Tangut characters, which are similar in appearance, it could be modified and applied in recognizing other documents without an existing training dataset.AcknowledgmentThe author would like to thank the reviewers.

The case is made for the cultural uses of local network infrastructures that combine wireless technology, low-cost hardware, and free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) applications. Based on these features, the toolkit MAZI (“together” in Greek), a Horizon 2020 project initiated by NITlab, University of Thessaly, Greece, has been deployed for creating pop-up local wi-fi zones independent from the internet, that enable digital interactions of communities within a low physical proximity coverage range. In this context, the focus is to explore the cultural-technological intersectionality of local community networks and its affordances as useful infrastructures for enhanced cultural event planning, humanities research and curatorial practices.The objectives of ICT-enabled local networking as a research, curatorial and communication tool within the scope of humanities, digital scholarship and the GLAM sector, can be directed to foster new participatory curatorial forms, the digital documentation of transient -off the internet- community knowledge sharing and inspiring alternative experiences of the locality and commonality.The three applied cases presented here are examples of physical proximity community networking platforms that have adjusted and utilised the open-source applications of the MAZI toolkit (NextCloud, Etherpad, LimeSurvey and Wordpress) in different cultural settings, mounting the toolkit on a low-sized hardware with minimal computing capabilities (Raspberry Pi):i. Media exchange, audience communication and voting in a cross-cultural Balkan eventThe toolkit was used for enhancing audience engagement during a multifaceted short film festival in the Balkan region. A platform was developed for sharing images, comments, chatting with local community members and enabling a voting system where individual preferences could be expressed. MAZI operated as a hands-on tool for building a participatory digital infrastructure for cultural event organisation, particularly suitable for outdoors or out of internet range areas. ii. Collaborative commenting and anonymous participation in community-based fieldwork research. During community-based research, we employed an array of participatory techniques that elicit multimodal qualitative data: collective drawing, collaborative creative writing, reflective blogging, storytelling. Protecting anonymity, ensuring privacy and ethical data recording was a critical part of the research project. We employed the build-in anonymity features of MAZI that allow users to connect and share without registering their identities (by default). In this setting, MAZI beared the potential to transform a group of people into a convivial, spontaneous and creative research community, producing critical and ready to analyze empirical data. iii. Digital exhibition hosting and community-based curation with added content. Digital exhibitions in HTML format built from scratch, hosted in a variety of open-source local networking infrastructures (Piratebox, Librarybox, MAZIzone). The exhibitions could be accessed only locally, on-site, traveling along the venues. The audience could explore the exhibition by connecting to the local network (no internet access) through their personal devices, with the option to upload their own content, collectively curating and contextualising the exhibition. The use case of MAZI here was utilising wireless local networks as exploratory digital curatorial tools.","ziku@mail.com, elli_2510@hotmail.com, abrailas@panteion.gr, smaglavera@gmail.com, giamavridis@gmail.com",Poster
